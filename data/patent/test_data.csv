     BACKGROUND 
     1. Technical Field 
     The present disclosure relates to the field of power transmission and transformation, and more particularly to an insulator and a power transmission line apparatus having the insulator. 
     2. Related Art 
     For a large amount of power transmission lines passing through a vast area, an ice layer is usually formed on the surface of the insulators and wires in a cold climate condition. The accidents such as line breakage, tower collapses and flashover trip-out might occur when the condition gets severe. A conventional insulator has surface materials such as room temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber and permanent RTV (PRTV) silicone rubber, which have good hydrophobicity at the room temperature. However, due to the characteristics of the materials, when the temperature approaches the zero degree, the hydrophobicity disappears and the material no longer has the ice-resistant capability. The ice-resisting method of generating heat through the power consumption to increase the surface temperature is the most effective ice-resistant measure at present, which has achieved a good effect in the ice-resistance of power transmission lines. However, in the application to the insulator, two problems to be solved are how to avoid influencing the insulating property of the insulator and how to control the loss. Currently, no effective measures are provided for eliminating or preventing the icing of the insulator, and the flashover accident of the insulator caused by the icing occurs now and then, such that the safe and stable operation of the electric power system is influenced. 
     SUMMARY 
     For the defects in the prior art, the present disclosure provides an insulator and a power transmission line apparatus having the insulator, such that during normal operation, the leakage current of the insulator is same as that of a conventional insulator, and in an icing climate condition, the value of the leakage current increases to increase the surface temperature of the insulator, thereby preventing the icing, while the power consumption is controlled at a relatively low level. 
     To achieve the above objective, the present disclosure adopts the following technical solution: 
     An insulator includes an insulating surface. A part of the insulating surface is applied with a conductive coating having a specific resistivity. A conductive coating region having the specific resistivity and a nonconductive coating region are configured such that in a dry environment, no continuous conductive channel exists between fittings at end portions of the insulator, and the insulating surface reaches an ice- resisting temperature in an icing climate condition due to a leakage current on the insulating surface caused by the conductive coating having the specific resistivity. 
     Preferably, the insulator is a disk-shaped suspension-type insulator, and a position of applying the conductive coating is selected within regions other than regions adjacent to an upper fitting of the insulator. 
     Preferably, the conductive coating is applied at a lower surface of the insulator. 
     Preferably, a volume resistivity of the conductive coating is between 10 3  ohm-centimeters and 10 5  ohm-centimeters. 
     Preferably, a coating thickness of the conductive coating is between 0.2 mm and 0.6 mm, and in particular between 0.3 mm and 0.4 mm. 
     Preferably, a main material of the conductive coating is conductive silicone rubber. 
     Preferably, the silicone rubber is added with carbon black, and in particular 10%-30% carbon black by weight. 
     Preferably, the nonconductive coating region is applied with RTV silicone rubber or PRTV silicone rubber. 
     Preferably, the insulator is a ceramic suspension-type insulator or a glass suspension-type insulator. 
     A power transmission line apparatus includes at least one of the above insulator, and preferably includes an insulator string formed of a plurality of the insulators connected to a power transmission line. 
     In the present disclosure, a conductive coating having a specific resistivity is applied on a part of surface of an insulator, such that first, in a dry environment, during normal operation of the insulator, the leakage current is basically the same as the case in which no conductive coating is adopted and no obvious leakage current occurs, and secondly, the part of surface being applied with the conductive coating has changed the surface resistivity distribution of a conventional insulator, such that the value of the leakage current at the surface of the insulator is increased in an icing climate condition, thereby achieving the effects of increasing the surface temperature of the insulator and preventing ice formation. Therefore, by applying the conductive coating having a specific resistivity at a part of surface of the insulator, the value of the leakage current on the surface of the insulator may change according to the climate environment: in a dry environment, no current or no obvious current occurs, and the insulator is equivalent to an open state of a switch; and in an icing environment, a current occurs, and the insulator is equivalent to a closed state of a switch, so as to form an insulator having a self-turn-off effect. 
     Furthermore, according to the present disclosure, as in a dry environment, the nonconductive coating region on the surface of the insulator leaves no continuous conductive channel between the upper and lower fittings, and the insulator keeps working in a case that the leakage current is relatively small, so the power energy consumption is low, and no obvious thermal effect occurs to accelerate the thermal aging of the silicone rubber. In an environment of a high humidity or rainfall and a low temperature, as the conductive coating region of the insulator has a good low temperature hydrophobicity, the insulating strength of the nonconductive coating region of the insulator decreases accordingly, and a corona and a local small arc discharge occur at the nonconductive coating region to increase the surface temperature, so as to prevent the ice layer from forming on the surface of the insulator. 
     Compared with the prior art, in the present disclosure, by applying a low-resistance coating on a part of surface of the insulator, in an icing, dewing and other high-humidity environment, the surface of the insulator may be dried through the heat generated from the surface discharge, so as to reduce the surface electric conductivity and prevent a pollution flashover accident, thereby facilitating the safe operation of the insulator of the power transmission line. Meanwhile, the insulator has a very low leakage current in a dry environment, so the power consumption level is reduced. Also, the technique of applying the surface coating according to the present disclosure is very simple, so the present disclosure has a very high cost efficiency and application value. 
     In a preferred embodiment, by adding heating filler carbon black in the surface coating, the surface coating can keep the hydrophobicity in a weather condition of low-temperature freezing rain. After the surface coating is applied in the insulator, the heating performance is good and the attachment and freezing of the supercooled water drops on the surface of the insulator can be effectively reduced, so as to facilitate the safe operation of the insulator of the power transmission line. The experimental results show that after the present disclosure is applied, the formation of the ice layer on the surface of the insulator and the formation of the icicles at the edges of the sheds can be effectively prevented.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
     The present disclosure is illustrated in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings and the specific embodiments. 
     In an embodiment, the insulator includes an insulating surface. A part of the insulating surface is applied with a conductive coating having a specific resistivity. Referring to  FIG. 1 , for an insulator according to an embodiment, a central line is taken as a border, the left half a of the central line is an outer surface view of the insulator, and the right half b is a sectional view of the insulator. The conductive coating region having the specific resistivity of the insulating surface is the surface between point  2  and point  3  in  FIG. 1 . The volume resistivity of the conductive coating having the specific resistivity is preferably 10 5  ohm-centimeters to form a low-temperature hydrophobic surface. The coating thickness is preferably between 0.3 mm and 0.4 mm. The region between point  1  and point  2  in  FIG. 1  is not applied with the conductive coating, which is a nonconductive coating region. The conductive coating region having the specific resistivity and the nonconductive coating region are configured that: in a dry environment, no continuous conductive channel exists between fittings at end portions of the insulator (for the insulator as shown in  FIG. 1 , between the upper and lower fittings). Also, due to the leakage current on the insulating surface caused by the conductive coating having the specific resistivity, in an icing climate condition, the insulating surface may reach an ice-proof temperature. The insulator as shown in  FIG. 1  and the conductive coating region, the coating thickness, and the volume resistivity are only exemplary, and it should be understood that as long as the applied conductive coating meets the above configuration condition, the objective of the present disclosure can be achieved. 
     Typically, a the disk-shaped suspension-type insulator is adopted. The position of applying the conductive coating is preferably selected from regions other than regions adjacent to the fittings on the insulator. 
     As shown in  FIG. 1 , in the preferred embodiment, the conductive coating is applied at a lower surface of the insulator, while the upper surface blank region that is not applied with the conductive coating extends to radial edges of the insulator. 
     In some embodiments, a volume resistivity of the conductive coating is preferably between 10 3  ohm-centimeters and 10 5  ohm-centimeters. 
     In some embodiments, the coating thickness of the conductive coating is preferably between 0.2 mm and 0.6 mm, and more preferably the coating thickness of the conductive coating is between 0.3 mm and 0.4 mm. 
     In one embodiment, the base material of the conductive coating is conductive silicone rubber. In particular, the volume resistivity of the silicone rubber is 10 5  ohm-centimeters. The coating thickness of the surface coating is about between 0.3 mm and 0.4 mm. 
     In some embodiments, the nonconductive coating region is applied with RTV silicone rubber or PRTV silicone rubber. 
     In some embodiments, the coating silicone rubber is preferably added with carbon black, and particularly 10%-30% carbon black by weight. The applied surface coating can keep the hydrophobicity in a weather condition of low-temperature freezing-rain, so that the heating performance of the insulator is good, so as to effectively reduce the attachment and freezing of the supercooled water drops on the surface of the insulator.

     The icing test voltage is an alternating current, 50 Hz, effective value being 63.5 kV, and the icing test lasts for three hours. 
     The climate chamber has two rows of nozzles on the left and right, two strings of insulators may be suspended in parallel in the middle, and the icing conditions for the two strings of insulators are the same. 
     (3) Test Result 
     After the icing, the icing forms of the two strings of insulators are as shown in  FIG. 2 . The values of the icing leakage current are as shown in  FIG. 3 . It can be seen from the contrast that no ice layers and icicles are formed on the surface of the insulator string according to the embodiments of the present disclosure. In the equivalent conditions, a condensed continuous ice layer is formed on the surface of the insulator without the coating. The icicles at the edges bridge the whole string of insulators. The test result indicates that the present disclosure can effectively prevent the ice from forming on the surface of the insulator. Meanwhile, in an ice-free environment, the insulator has a very low leakage current and a low power consumption level.

     Organizations often deploy a variety of anti-malware and/or file-filtering technologies in order to prevent potentially malicious files from infecting or being installed on computing devices within the organizations. In one example, an organization may compile a blacklist that identifies malicious and/or untrusted files. In the event that a user within the organization attempts to access an untrusted file, an anti-malware program on the user&#39;s computing device may block or prevent the user from downloading and/or installing the file in response to identifying the file on the blacklist. In another example, an organization may compile a whitelist that identifies files allowed to be accessed within the organization. 
     Unfortunately, traditional methods for creating whitelists and blacklists may be inefficient, inconvenient, and/or unable to accurately determine whether a file is trusted or untrusted. For example, a conventional whitelisting technology may rely on receiving approval of files from specified managers and/or Information Technology (IT) administrators within an organization. In organizations that handle large numbers of new files, managers or administrators may be overburdened and unable to keep up with approving or denying each file requested by users within the organizations. As a result, individuals within an organization may be blocked from accessing legitimate, harmless, and/or important files (e.g., files created by members of the organization that are not recognized by traditional anti-malware programs). In addition, users within organizations may choose to disable anti-malware programs in the event that the programs are too disruptive and/or unreliable. Therefore, the instant disclosure identifies and addresses a need for improved systems and methods for determining the trustworthiness of files within organizations. 
     SUMMARY 
     As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure describes various systems and methods for determining the trustworthiness of files within organizations by prompting multiple users within an organization to manually evaluate the trustworthiness of a file. The systems and methods described herein may then allow or block the file within the organization based on evaluations of the file by the users within the organization. 
     In one example, a computer-implemented method for determining the trustworthiness of files within organizations may include (1) identifying a file on a computing device within multiple computing devices managed by an organization, (2) in response to identifying the file, identifying at least one additional computing device within the multiple computing devices that is potentially associated with the file, (3) distributing at least a portion of the file to a user of the additional computing device with a request to receive an indication of the trustworthiness of the file, and then (4) receiving, from the additional computing device, a response that indicates the trustworthiness of the file. In some embodiments, the method may further include providing, to the user of the additional computing device, a virtual execution environment in which to analyze the file. 
     In some examples, identifying the file on the computing device may include detecting an attempt by a user of the computing device to install and/or download the file onto the computing device. Additionally or alternatively, identifying the file on the computing device may include detecting an attempt by a user of the computing device to execute the file on the computing device. 
     In some embodiments, identifying the additional computing device that is potentially associated with the file may include identifying at least one characteristic of a user of the computing device. The method may then include identifying a computing device of an additional user within the organization that has the characteristic. 
     In some examples, distributing the portion of the file to the user of the additional computing device may include distributing information about a source of the file. Additionally or alternatively, distributing the portion of the file may include distributing information about behaviors exhibited by the file. 
     In some embodiments, after receiving the response from the user of the additional computing device, the method may further include determining that the user of the additional computing device is a trusted reviewer. In some examples, determining that the user of the additional computing device is the trusted reviewer may include (1) receiving, from the user of the additional computing device, a justification of the indication of the trustworthiness of the file, (2) displaying the justification of the indication of the trustworthiness of the file to multiple users within the organization, and then (3) determining that at least a certain number of users within the organization indicate that the justification is trusted. Additionally or alternatively, determining that the user of the additional computing device is the trusted reviewer may include determining that the user of the additional computing device has correctly indicated the trustworthiness of at least a certain number of files identified on the computing devices within the organization. 
     In some embodiments, the method may further include providing at least one reward to the user of the additional computing device in response to determining that the user of the additional computing device is the trusted reviewer. In some examples, providing the reward to the user of the additional computing device may include, when identifying an additional file on the additional computing device, allowing the user of the additional computing device to access the additional file before receiving an indication that the additional file is trustworthy from a user of another computing device within the organization. 
     In some examples, the method may further include distributing, to the user of the additional computing device, a request to identify permissions that should be granted to the file when the file is executed by the computing devices within the organization. The method may then include receiving, from the additional computing device, at least one allowed permission in response to the request. Next, the method may include preventing the file from being granted permissions other than the allowed permission when the file is executed by the computing devices within the organization. 
     In some embodiments, the method may further include determining that the response from the additional computing device indicates that the file is trustworthy. In such embodiments, the method may include adding the file to a whitelist that identifies files allowed to be accessed by the computing devices within the organization. In other embodiments, the method may include determining that the response from the additional computing device indicates that the file is untrustworthy. In such embodiments, the method may include adding the file to a blacklist that identifies files not allowed to be accessed by the computing devices within the organization. 
     In one embodiment, a system for implementing the above-described method may include (1) an identification module that (a) identifies a file on a computing device within multiple computing devices managed by an organization and (b) in response to identifying the file, identifies at least one additional computing device within the multiple computing devices that is potentially associated with the file, (2) a distribution module that distributes at least a portion of the file to a user of the additional computing device with a request to receive an indication of the trustworthiness of the file, and (3) a reception module that receives, from the additional computing device, a response that indicates the trustworthiness of the file. In addition, the system may include at least one physical processor configured to execute the identification module, the distribution module, and the reception module. 
     In some examples, the above-described method may be encoded as computer-readable instructions on a non-transitory computer-readable medium. For example, a computer-readable medium may include one or more computer-executable instructions that, when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, may cause the computing device to (1) identify a file on a computing device within multiple computing devices managed by an organization, (2) in response to identifying the file, identify at least one additional computing device within the multiple computing devices that is potentially associated with the file, (3) distribute at least a portion of the file to a user of the additional computing device with a request to receive an indication of the trustworthiness of the file, and then (4) receive, from the additional computing device, a response that indicates the trustworthiness of the file

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS 
     The present disclosure is generally directed to systems and methods for determining the trustworthiness of files within organizations. As will be explained in greater detail below, by prompting multiple users within an organization to analyze the trustworthiness of files before the files are allowed to be accessed within the organization, the systems and methods described herein may crowd-source reviews of files to reduce the burden of IT administrators having to approve or deny each incoming file. Furthermore, by selecting members of an organization that may be more qualified to review a file (e.g., users that may have the technical knowledge to properly analyze a file), the disclosed systems and methods may obtain fast and accurate indications of the trustworthiness of a file. As such, the systems and methods described herein may efficiently build whitelists and/or blacklists to ensure that only legitimate and/or secure files are accessed within an organization. 
     The following will provide, with reference to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , detailed descriptions of exemplary systems for determining the trustworthiness of files within organizations. Detailed descriptions of corresponding computer-implemented methods will also be provided in connection with  FIG. 3 . In addition, detailed descriptions of computing devices managed by an organization will be provided in connection with  FIG. 4 . Detailed descriptions of requests sent to computing devices to determine the trustworthiness of files and responses sent from computing devices that indicate the trustworthiness of files will also be provided in connection with  FIG. 5 . Finally, detailed descriptions of an exemplary computing system and network architecture capable of implementing one or more of the embodiments described herein will be provided in connection with  FIGS. 6 and 7 , respectively. 
       FIG. 1  is a block diagram of an exemplary system  100  for determining the trustworthiness of files within organizations. As illustrated in this figure, exemplary system  100  may include one or more modules  102  for performing one or more tasks. For example, and as will be explained in greater detail below, exemplary system  100  may include an identification module  104  that (1) identifies a file on a computing device within multiple computing devices managed by an organization and (2) in response to identifying the file, identifies at least one computing device within the multiple computing devices managed by the organization that is potentially associated with the file. Exemplary system  100  may also include a distribution module  106  that distributes at least a portion of the file to a user of the additional computing device with a request to receive an indication of the trustworthiness of the file. 
     In addition, and as will be described in greater detail below, exemplary system  100  may include a reception module  108  that receives, from the additional computing device, a response that indicates the trustworthiness of the file. Exemplary system  100  may also include a security module  110  that performs one or more security actions based on the response from the additional computing device. Finally, exemplary system  100  may include a reward module  112  that provides at least one reward to the user of the additional computing device in response to determining that the user of the additional computing device is a trusted reviewer. Although illustrated as separate elements, one or more of modules  102  in  FIG. 1  may represent portions of a single module or application. 
     In certain embodiments, one or more of modules  102  in  FIG. 1  may represent one or more software applications or programs that, when executed by a computing device, may cause the computing device to perform one or more tasks. For example, and as will be described in greater detail below, one or more of modules  102  may represent software modules stored and configured to run on one or more computing devices, such as the devices illustrated in  FIG. 2  (e.g., computing device  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N)), computing system  610  in  FIG. 6 , and/or portions of exemplary network architecture  700  in  FIG. 7 . One or more of modules  102  in  FIG. 1  may also represent all or portions of one or more special-purpose computers configured to perform one or more tasks. 
     Exemplary system  100  in  FIG. 1  may be implemented in a variety of ways. For example, all or a portion of exemplary system  100  may represent portions of exemplary system  200  in  FIG. 2 . As shown in  FIG. 2 , system  200  may include a computing device  202  in communication with computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) via a network  204 . In the example of  FIG. 2 , computing device  202  may be programmed with one or more of modules  102 . Additionally or alternatively, computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) may be programmed with one or more of modules  102 . 
     In one embodiment, one or more of modules  102  from  FIG. 1  may, when executed by at least one processor of computing device  202 , enable computing device  202  to determine the trustworthiness of files within organizations. For example, and as will be described in greater detail below, identification module  104  may cause computing device  202  to identify a file (e.g., file  208 ) on at least one computing device (e.g., computing device  202 ) within multiple computing devices (e.g., computing device  202  and computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N)) managed by an organization. In addition, identification module  104  may cause computing device  202  to, in response to identifying file  208 , identify at least one computing device within computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) (e.g., computing device  206 ( 1 )) that is potentially associated with file  208 . Next, distribution module  106  may cause computing device  202  to distribute at least a portion of file  208  to a user of computing device  206 ( 1 ) with a request (e.g., request  210 ) to receive an indication of the trustworthiness of file  208 . Finally, reception module  108  may cause computing device  202  to receive, from computing device  206 ( 1 ), a response (e.g., response  212 ) that indicates the trustworthiness of file  208 . 
     Computing device  202  and computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) generally represent any type or form of computing devices capable of reading computer-executable instructions. Examples of computing device  202  include, without limitation, laptops, tablets, desktops, servers, cellular phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), multimedia players, embedded systems, wearable devices (e.g., smart watches, smart glasses, etc.), gaming consoles, combinations of one or more of the same, exemplary computing system  610  in  FIG. 6 , or any other suitable computing device. 
     In some embodiments, computing device  202  and computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) may represent computing devices managed by a single organization. The term “organization,” as used herein, generally refers to any group or set of individuals that share any type or form of association or connection. Examples of organizations include, without limitation, businesses, enterprises, companies, schools, non-profit organizations, clubs, teams, members of online forums, individuals who subscribe to certain online services, combinations or one or more of the same, variations of one or more of the same, and/or any additional type of organization. 
     In one example, computing device  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) may represent personal computing devices assigned to and/or managed by individual members of an organization. Additionally or alternatively, one or more of computing device  202  and computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) may represent servers and/or databases configured to store and/or analyze files identified within an organization. In an exemplary embodiment, at least a portion of the systems described herein may be installed on each of computing device  202  and computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) as part of an organization-wide anti-malware program. For example, all or a portion of computing device  202  and computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) may be configured with identification module  104  in order to detect each file accessed by the computing devices. A central server or database, in communication with computing device  202  and computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N), may host distribution module  106  and/or reception module  108  in order to facilitate crowd-sourcing reviews of the trustworthiness of each file identified by computing device  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N). 
     Network  204  generally represents any medium or architecture capable of facilitating communication or data transfer. In some embodiments, computing devices  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) may be in communication with one another via network  204 . In one example, network  204  may represent a private and/or local network configured by an organization that manages computing device  202  and computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N). Additionally or alternatively, network  204  may provide computing devices  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) access to online services and networks external to the organization. Examples of network  204  include, without limitation, an intranet, a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Local Area Network (LAN), a Personal Area Network (PAN), the Internet, Power Line Communications (PLC), a cellular network (e.g., a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network), exemplary network architecture  700  in  FIG. 7 , or the like. Network  204  may facilitate communication or data transfer using wireless or wired connections. 
       FIG. 3  is a flow diagram of an exemplary computer-implemented method  300  for determining the trustworthiness of files within organizations. The steps shown in  FIG. 3  may be performed by any suitable computer-executable code and/or computing system. In some embodiments, the steps shown in  FIG. 3  may be performed by one or more of the components of system  100  in  FIG. 1 , system  200  in  FIG. 2 , computing system  610  in  FIG. 6 , and/or portions of exemplary network architecture  700  in  FIG. 7 . 
     As illustrated in  FIG. 3 , at step  302  one or more of the systems described herein may identify a file on at least one computing device within multiple computing devices managed by an organization. For example, identification module  104  may, as part of computing device  202  in  FIG. 2 , identify file  208  on computing device  202 . 
     The term “file,” as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of formatted portion of data or executable code. Examples of files include, without limitation, text files, image files, executable files, audiovisual files, compressed files, data files, database files, combinations of one or more of the same, variations of one or more of the same, and/or any additional type of file. 
     The systems described herein may identify a file on a computing device in a variety of ways. In some examples, identification module  104  may identify file  208  while monitoring computing device  202  for any indication that computing device  202  is accessing a new and/or unfamiliar file. For example, identification module  104  may detect all or a portion of the attempts made by a user of computing device  202  to install, download, upload, transfer, store, save, and/or execute files on computing device  202 . In these examples, identification module  104  may identify file  208  on computing device  202  before file  208  has an opportunity to alter the configuration of computing device  202 . In this way, the systems described herein may verify the trustworthiness of file  208  before file  208  is able to potentially compromise the safety and/or security of computing device  202 . 
     In other examples, identification module  104  may identify file  208  after file  208  has been installed, downloaded, and/or executed on computing device  202 . In these examples, identification module  104  may identify file  208  while analyzing existing files on computing device  202 . For example, identification module  104  may periodically (e.g., every week, every month, etc.) examine the files on computing device  202  (as well as files on computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N)) for any indication that the existing files may be malicious. 
     Returning to  FIG. 3 , at step  304  one or more of the systems described herein may, in response to identifying the file, identify at least one additional computing device within the multiple computing devices managed by the organization that is potentially associated with the file. For example, in response to identifying file  208 , identification module  104  may, as part of computing device  202 , identify at least one of computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) that is potentially associated with file  208 . 
     The systems described herein may identify a computing device that is potentially associated with a file in a variety of ways. In some examples, identification module  104  may identify the computing device of any user within the organization that manages computing device  202  that may be able to accurately determine the trustworthiness of file  208 . For example, identification module  104  may identify the computing devices of any users within the organization that share one or more characteristics with the user of computing device  202 . Specifically, identification module  104  may identify a department or division to which the user of computing device  202  belongs and then identify members of the same department or division. In another example, identification module  104  may identify all or a portion of the computing devices within the organization that have previously accessed files similar to file  208  and/or that have a similar software or hardware configuration as computing device  202 . 
     In some embodiments, identification module  104  may identify relevant users by identifying users who are known to be trusted reviewers (e.g., users whose judgement about the trustworthiness of files is presumed or proven to be reliable). Additionally or alternatively, identification module  104  may identify users who are not overburdened with requests to review files. For example, identification module  104  may identify users who have not exceeded a certain quota of reviews (e.g., five reviews in the past month, 20 reviews in total, etc.). Moreover, identification module  104  may identify users based on a recommendation or request from the user of computing device  202  (e.g., the user of computing device  202  may specify one or more users that should review file  208 ). 
     Furthermore, in some embodiments, identification module  104  may identify a certain number (e.g., 10 or 25) or a certain percentage (e.g., 5% or 10%) of computing devices or users. For example, identification module  104  may identify at least a certain number of computing devices within computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) that are potentially associated with file  208  in order to ensure a comprehensive assessment of file  208 . Identification module  104  may identify the multiple computing devices (or users of the multiple computing devices) using any one or combination of the techniques described above and/or any additional identification technique. 
     As an example,  FIG. 4  illustrates multiple computing devices managed by an organization. In this example, computing devices  406 ( 1 )-( 9 ) may represent individual computing devices of members of a single organization. In one example, identification module  104  may identify file  208  on computing device  406 ( 5 ). In response, identification module  104  may analyze properties of computing device  406 ( 5 ), properties of the user of computing device  406 ( 5 ), and/or properties of the remaining users and computing devices within the organization to identify one or more computing devices that may be potentially associated with file  208 . In the example of  FIG. 4 , identification module  104  may determine that four computing devices (i.e., computing devices  406 ( 1 ),  406 ( 2 ),  406 ( 7 ), and  406 ( 9 )) are potentially associated with file  208 . 
     Returning to  FIG. 3 , at step  306  one or more of the systems described herein may distribute at least a portion of the file to a user of the additional computing device with a request to receive an indication of the trustworthiness of the file. For example, distribution module  106  may, as part of computing device  202  in  FIG. 2 , distribute at least a portion of file  208  with request  210  to at least one of computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N). 
     The systems described herein may distribute a request for an indication of the trustworthiness of a file in a variety of ways. In some examples, distribution module  106  may distribute a copy of request  210  to each previously-identified computing device that may potentially be associated with file  208 . For example, distribution module  106  may distribute request  210  by emailing request  210  to messaging accounts managed by users of the identified computing devices or posting request  210  on an online forum accessible to the users of the identified computing devices. Furthermore, in some embodiments, distribution module  106  may distribute request  210  to each identified computing device before computing device  202  is allowed to access (e.g., install, download, or execute) file  208 . 
     Referring to the example of  FIG. 4 , distribution module  106  may distribute a copy of request  210  to each relevant computing device identified within computing devices  406 ( 1 )-( 9 ). As shown in  FIG. 4 , computing devices  406 ( 1 ),  406 ( 2 ),  406 ( 7 ), and  406 ( 9 ) may each receive a copy of request  210 . 
     In some examples, request  210  may contain all or a portion of the content of file  208  (or a link that provides access to file  208 ). Additionally or alternatively, request  210  may contain information associated with file  208  but not stored within file  208 . For example, request  210  may contain information about the context of file  208  within the organization that manages computing device  202 . Specifically, request  210  may indicate which computing devices and/or how many computing devices within the organization have attempted to access file  208 . In another example, request  210  may include information about the source of file  208 , such as a software distributor that created file  208 , a compiler or other program used to generate file  208 , and/or websites that host file  208 . In a further example, request  210  may include information about behaviors exhibited by file  208  and/or permissions requested by file  208 . In general, request  210  may contain any information relevant to file  208  that may enable a reviewer to accurately and/or efficiently determine the trustworthiness of file  208 . 
     Distribution module  106  may prompt reviewers (via request  210 ) to determine the trustworthiness of file  208  in a variety of ways. In some examples, distribution module  106  may direct reviewers to perform a malware scan or similar analysis on file  208 . Additionally or alternatively, distribution module  106  may direct reviewers to run or execute file  208  to identify any unusual, suspicious, or malicious behaviors exhibited by file  208 . In some embodiments, the systems described herein may provide computing device  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) with a virtual execution environment in which to analyze file  208 . The term “virtual execution environment,” as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of execution space that may be separated or partitioned from another execution space. Distribution module  106  may provide users of computing device  202  and computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) with a virtual execution environment in any suitable manner, such as by partitioning a portion of the hard drives of each computing device or by hosting virtual machines accessible to the computing devices. In this way, the systems described herein may enable reviewers to thoroughly examine all potentially negative consequences of executing incoming files while not allowing the files to infect, corrupt or otherwise harm their own computing devices. 
     In addition, distribution module  106  may direct users to provide their assessment of the trustworthiness of file  208  in a variety of ways. In some examples, distribution module  106  may simply direct users to indicate whether their assessment of file  208  is positive (e.g., “trustworthy” or “good”) or negative (e.g., “untrustworthy” or “bad”). In other examples, distribution module  106  may prompt reviewers to indicate the trustworthiness of file  208  within a range or scale. For example, distribution module  106  may direct reviewers to select a number between 1-10, with 10 corresponding to a strong indication of trustworthiness. 
     Furthermore, in some embodiments, distribution module  106  may prompt reviewers to provide information in addition to an indication of the trustworthiness of file  208 . For example, distribution module  106  may include, within request  210 , a request for a reviewer to indicate one or more permissions that should be granted to file  208  when file  208  is executed by computing device  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N). In one example, distribution module  106  may direct a reviewer to list or select any permissions (e.g., permission to connect to other devices via a certain network, permission to install drivers, permission to inject threads, permission to launch other processes, etc.) that are required by file  208  and/or that will not enable file  208  to perform any malicious behaviors. In addition, distribution module  106  may prompt a reviewer to indicate any restrictions that should be imposed on the behavior of file  208 , such as restrictions on networks file  208  can access and/or restrictions on the amount of data uploaded or downloaded by file  208 . 
     Additionally or alternatively, distribution module  106  may prompt reviewers to provide a justification of the indication of the trustworthiness of file  208 . Specifically, distribution module  106  may direct a reviewer to generate a short written explanation of the reasons why a certain indication of trustworthiness was chosen (e.g., based on behaviors exhibited by file  208  when analyzing file  208 ). As will be explained in greater detail below, justifications of indications of trustworthiness may be used to determine whether a reviewer is a trusted reviewer. Additionally or alternatively, justifications may be used by other reviewers to confirm or enhance their own assessments of files. 
     As an example,  FIG. 5  illustrates a portion of the information that may be included within request  210 . In this example, request  210  may indicate that a file with a filename of “File1.exe” was identified on the computing device of a user known as “User1.” Furthermore, request  210  may prompt the receiver of request  210  to analyze File1.exe using a virtual execution environment. Request  210  may include any additional information, such as information about the source of File1.exe and/or the prevalence of File1.exe within an organization to which User1 belongs. 
     Returning to  FIG. 3 , at step  308  one or more of the systems described herein may receive, from the additional computing device, a response that indicates the trustworthiness of the file. For example, reception module  108  may, as part of computing device  202  in  FIG. 2 , receive, from at least one of computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N), response  212  that indicates the trustworthiness of file  208 . 
     The systems described herein may receive a response that indicates the trustworthiness of a file in a variety of ways. In some examples, reception module  108  may receive response  212  in an email or other electronic message (e.g., in the event that distribution module  106  distributed request  210  via an electronic message). In other examples, reception module  108  may identify response  212  on an online forum configured to display responses from members of the organization that manages computing device  202 . 
     In some embodiments, the systems described herein may determine whether file  208  is trustworthy or untrustworthy based on response  212  and/or additional responses from additional reviewers. The term “untrusted file,” as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of file that may compromise the integrity and/or security of a computing device. In some examples, a file may be untrusted if it has an unverified and/or malicious source. Additionally or alternatively, an untrusted file may exhibit any suspicious or malicious behaviors. In contrast, the term “trusted file,” as used herein, generally refers to any type or form of file that is known or presumed to be benign, legitimate, and/or useful to the operation of a computing device. 
     In one example, security module  110  may determine that file  208  is trustworthy in the event that each polled member within the organization indicates that file  208  is trustworthy (or is trustworthy above a certain threshold, such as being assigned a trustworthiness value of “8” on a scale of 1-10). Conversely, security module  110  may determine that file  208  is untrustworthy in the event that one or more polled members within the organization indicate that file  208  is untrustworthy (or is trustworthy below a certain threshold). In other examples, security module  110  may determine whether file  208  is trustworthy based at least in part on justifications of the indications of trustworthiness. For example, security module  110  may determine that file  208  is trustworthy in the event that one or more responses from reviewers contain justifications such as “file  208  does not exhibit any suspicious behaviors” or “file  208  is a necessary work-related file.” 
     As an example,  FIG. 5  illustrates a portion of the information that may be included within response  212 . As shown in  FIG. 5 , response  212  may indicate that the File1.exe is trustworthy. In addition, response  212  may justify the indication that File1.exe is trustworthy by stating that File1.exe does not exhibit any unusual or suspicious behaviors. Furthermore, response  212  may indicate that when executed, File1.exe should be granted permissions to install drivers, launch processes, and access networks. 
     The systems described herein may perform a variety of actions based on the determination of the trustworthiness of file  208 . In the event that security module  110  determines that file  208  is trustworthy, security module  110  may allow computing device  202  to access (e.g., download, install, and/or execute) file  208 . Furthermore, in some examples, security module  110  may allow one or more of computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N) to access file  208  in response to the determination that file  208  is trustworthy. For example, security module  110  may add file  208  to a whitelist that identifies files allowed to be accessed by computing device  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N). The whitelist may be maintained on each computing device within the organization and/or on a central server that monitors files accessed by computing devices within the organization. When a user of a computing device within the organization attempts to access an instance of file  208 , the systems described herein may identify file  208  on the whitelist and automatically enable the user to access the file. 
     Notably, in some examples, security module  110  may restrict the operation of file  208  on computing devices within the organization based on the allowed permissions identified by reviewers within the organization. For example, security module  110  may prevent file  208  from being granted permissions other than the allowed permissions when file  208  is executed by computing device  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N). 
     In the event that security module  110  determines that file  208  is untrustworthy, security module  110  may prevent computing device  202  from accessing file  208 . In addition, in some examples, security module  110  may prevent other computing devices within the organization from accessing file  208  by adding file  208  to a blacklist that identifies files not allowed to be accessed by computing device  202  and/or computing devices  206 ( 1 )-(N). In some embodiments, after creating a whitelist and/or blacklist of allowed or denied files, the systems described herein may export the whitelist and/or blacklist to other entities or organizations. As such, the systems described herein may help determine or establish the global reputation of one or more files (instead of just the reputations of files only within an organization). 
     In some examples, security module  110  may alert an administrator within the organization in response to the determination about the trustworthiness of file  208 . For example, security module  110  may notify an administrator that a new file has been determined to be trustworthy or untrustworthy and/or which computing devices within the organization have accessed file  208 . In another example, security module  110  may provide an update to an administrator that file  208  has been added to a whitelist or a blacklist. While the systems described herein may eliminate or reduce the need of an administrator within an organization to manually approve or block files within the organization, an administrator may still be notified of additions to a whitelist and/or maintain control over files added to the whitelist. 
     As previously mentioned, the systems described herein may determine whether a user is a trusted reviewer. The term “trusted reviewer,” as used herein, generally refers to any member of an organization whose judgement about the trustworthiness of files is presumed or proven to be reliable. In some examples, a reviewer may be deemed trusted based on the reviewer&#39;s history of determining the trustworthiness of files identified within an organization. For example, a reviewer may be labelled as trusted in the event that a certain number or percentage of a reviewer&#39;s decisions regarding previous files have been proven to be accurate (e.g., based on subsequent malware scans of the files and/or the assessments of other reviewers). In other examples, a reviewer may be labelled as trusted based on the reviewer holding a certain position within an organization (e.g., a manager or IT administrator). 
     Additionally or alternatively, a reviewer may be labelled as trusted based on one or more justifications about the trustworthiness of files provided by the reviewer. For example, reception module  108  may display justifications from a reviewer on an online forum accessible to users within an organization. Users may then evaluate the justifications and indicate whether the justifications are trusted, informative, well-written, etc. In one example, users may provide a positive assessment of the justification (e.g., an “upvote” or “like)” or a negative assessment of the justification (e.g., a “downvote” or “dislike”). The systems described herein may then identify trusted reviewers by identifying reviewers who have received at least a certain number of positive assessments or certain percentage of positive assessments (e.g., compared to negative assessments). 
     In some embodiments, the systems described herein may provide one or more rewards to trusted reviewers. For example, reward module  112  may offer incentives to users within an organization in order to encourage the users to accurately review files, review greater numbers of files, and/or provide helpful justifications about decisions made concerning the trustworthiness of files. Trusted reviewers may receive any type or form of reward or incentive. In an exemplary embodiment, reward module  112  may reward trusted reviewers by giving trusted reviewers the privilege to access files before the files have been analyzed and found to be trustworthy by other users. For example, reward module  112  may enable trusted reviewers to decide for themselves whether a file is trustworthy or untrustworthy and then access the file according to their decision. 
     As explained above, a computing device within an organization may identify a file that a user is attempting to access on the computing device. In response to identifying the file, the computing device may identify one or more additional users and/or computing devices within the organization that may be potentially associated with the file. For example, the computing device may identify computing devices that have a similar configuration to the computing device that attempted to access the file and/or computing devices of users who are known to be trusted reviewers of files. The computing device may then distribute the file to the additional computing devices with a request to analyze the file to determine the trustworthiness of the file. Based on the responses from the additional computing devices, the computing device may allow the file within the organization (in the event that the file is determined to be trustworthy) or block the file within the organization (in the event that the file is determined to be untrustworthy).

     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention relates generally to the testing of logic designs, and more particularly to a method and system for generating a test case specific to a particular design-under-test (DUT) from a generalized or comprehensive set of bus transactions characterizing a bus architecture. 
     A process known as verification comprises applying test cases to a DUT and checking the results against expected results to determine whether the DUT functions correctly. Functional verification of logic designs which interface to standardized buses typically involves the use of a software tool known as a bus functional model (BFM). A BFM emulates a bus protocol to apply a test case in simulation to a DUT modeled by a hardware description language (HDL). 
     The BFMs allow verification engineers to write test cases as bus transactions. The bus transactions may be expressed in bus functional language (BFL) statements which are decoded and executed by the BFMs using a logic simulator. For example, a standardized BFM transaction test case for a 32 bit data slave design that uses read and write transactions with address, data, and control signal information could comprise BFL statements appearing as follows (comments indicated by “//”): 
     
       
         
               
               
             
                   
               
                 read(address=F0,be=1111,data=00000034) 
                 //4 byte read transaction 
               
                   
                 from addr F0;

                 // 1 byte write data is 12; 
               
                 read(address=F0,be=1111,data=12000034)

     In the foregoing example, read and write are two different transaction types, while address, byte enable, and data are parameters of the respective transaction types. The parameters were used to specify data to be written to an address, and to subsequently read the address to determine whether the data was correctly written. 
     In order to verify that a DUT completely complies with a standardized bus interface, all possible bus transactions must be performed to ensure that the DUT-to-bus interface operates under all legal bus conditions. This process, also known as regression testing, entails the enumeration of all possible and legal transaction combinations to ensure a complete and correct design. 
     Typically, test cases for applying all the possible and legal transactions for a DUT-to-bus interface must be specified manually, as BFL statements as shown in the above example. To code the BFL statements, a verification engineer must usually consult a bus architecture specification manual. As the complexity of logic designs increases, the number of transactions which must be applied to a design to fully test it for bus compliance becomes unmanageable by a manual procedure. The procedure becomes unduly time-consuming, and the likelihood that coding errors occur or that needed test cases are omitted increases. 
     In view of the foregoing, a method and system for efficiently generating test cases is called for. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     In the method and system according to the present invention, a set of transactions characterizing a bus architecture is provided. A subset of the set corresponding to a specific DUT is selected, and a configuration file for verifying the DUT is generated from the selected subset. The configuration file includes rules specific to the DUT, and may be processed by a generator program to generate or enumerate bus transactions, as determined by the rules, for a test case to be applied to the DUT. 
     In an embodiment, a graphical user interface may be used to create the configuration file. The user interface presents a user with the possible bus transactions of a bus architecture, and allows the user to enter inputs corresponding to a particular DUT. The interface processes the inputs to generate a configuration file syntax used by the generator program. The interface automatically inserts parameter combination specifications and rules into the configuration file for the user. 
     The advantages offered by the foregoing include greater ease and speed of designing test cases for verification of designs, and avoiding the errors inherent in a manual procedure. A designer of a test case does not need to consult a bus architectural specification, since the set of transactions characterizing the bus is presented in the user interface. A test case may be designed by simply entering a series of inputs relating to a specific DUT via the interface, which then automatically produces the configuration file.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
     As shown in FIG. 1A, in the method according to the invention, a bus architecture file  100  is provided. The bus architecture file  100  is processed by a user selection process  101  to select a subset of transactions corresponding to a specific DUT, as defined by transaction types and parameter combinations specified in a DUT configuration file  102 . 
     The bus architecture file  100  comprises a comprehensive set of bus transactions characterizing a bus architecture; i.e., the complete set of transactions executable by a particular bus design, such as a processor local bus (PLB) in a PowerPC® embedded processor architecture. By the user selection process  101 , the comprehensive set of bus transactions of the bus architecture file  100  are customized or tailored to a specific DUT with which the bus interfaces, typically a smaller subset of the comprehensive set. 
     As shown in FIG. 1B, a table configuration file  103  may also be input to the user selection process  101 . The table configuration file comprises table entries corresponding to the bus architecture. The user selection process may be implemented with a graphical user interface which presents a user with a set of possible selections based on the bus architecture file and the table configuration file. The user makes selections related to a specific DUT to produce a DUT configuration file  102 . 
     The bus architecture file  100  and DUT configuration file  102  may be expressed in a condensed or compact syntax which allows for a description of the bus transactions of a particular bus architecture or of a DUT to be expressed in an economical form suitable for being expanded or enumerated by a generator program. As shown in FIG. 1C, the DUT configuration file produced by the user selection process may subsequently be processed by the generator program  104  to generate a test case  105  comprising one or more bus transactions, typically expressed in bus functional language, for verification of the DUT. The generator program forms transaction parameter combinations and tests them against rules to determine whether a combination should be included in a test case, as described in more detail hereinafter. 
     As shown in FIG. 1D, the test case may be applied by a BFM  106  to a DUT  107  being simulated by a logic simulator  108 , in order to verify the DUT. 
     As described above, the user selection process may be implemented with a graphical or text-based user interface, which presents a user with a set of possible selections corresponding to a bus architecture file. An example of a portion of a display of such an interface, corresponding to a PLB architecture, is shown in FIG.  2 . As seen in the portion of the display shown, the user interface lets the user enter such DUT-specific information as the transfer mode (Single or Burst), transfer width (byte, half-word, word, double-word, etc.), transfer type (memory, plb slave buffered), and other information. 
     The interface provides for the automatic generation of the DUT configuration file syntax from the bus architecture file syntax. The syntax includes parameter combination specifications and rules. The parameter combination specifications are used by the generator to systematically generate or enumerate possible bus transactions for output to a test case, and the rules provide for the exclusion of specified parameter combinations from the test case to customize the generated parameter combinations to a particular DUT. The parameterized bus transactions may be used to test compliance of the DUT with the bus architecture. 
     The bus architecture file  100  and the table configuration file  103  facilitate the implementation of the user interface. The bus architecture file provides such information to the user interface as base rules for the bus, types of possible transactions for the bus (e.g., reads and writes), and other information. The table configuration file provides table entries corresponding to the possible transactions of the bus architecture and may be updated by user selections via the user interface. The updated table entries are used to produce a specific DUT configuration file. The table configuration file also provides information for generating the visual display of the user interface. 
     A process flow illustrating the user selection process is shown in FIG.  3 . As shown in block  300 , a user interface such as shown in FIG. 2 is presented to a user. To generate the visual interface for presentation, each entry of the table configuration file  103  is parsed, parameter values in the table entries are read and the read values are inserted into the display. 
     Then, as shown in blocks  301  and  302 , the user interface accepts user inputs to change table entries, including allowing a user to insert a custom rule or rules if desired. When a user has made all the desired changes to the table entries, the changes are saved as shown in block  303 . 
     Next, as shown in blocks  304  and  305 , the user interface parses the changed table entries to generate the DUT configuration file syntax, including generating parameter combination specifications and rules as described above, corresponding to the user inputs. When the interface is finished parsing the table entries and generating the DUT configuration syntax as determined by decision block  306 , it outputs the DUT configuration file  102  as shown in block  307 . The DUT configuration file may subsequently be processed by a generator as described above to produce a test case comprising one or more bus transactions. 
     Fields within a table entry of the table configuration file allow for the selection, via the interface, of a particular set of values corresponding to a specific DUT. The interface will convert the selected values into syntactical statements in the syntax described above; elements of the syntax are described in greater detail below. The syntactical statements are then in a form for being processed by the generator to produce a test case. 
     As an example, a given bus architecture might have a 32-bit address range (x00000000 to xFFFFFFFF), and this would be reflected in an initial address range presented by the user interface. A DUT may be address-mapped and support only a subset of that address range, for example, x00000000 to x8FFFFFF. A user wanting to create a test case for that DUT might want to perform read transactions to addresses x00000000 through x5FFFFFFF, and write transactions to addresses x60000000 through x8FFFFFFF. 
     Accordingly, via the user interface, the user would alter the address ranges for the respective transactions as desired, and save the changes. The user interface would then execute a routine which would result in syntactical statements reflecting the changes for output to a DUT configuration file. Specifically, in one possible formulation of the configuration file syntax, a parameter combination specification would be created that, when processed by the generator, would enumerate addresses x00000000 to x8FFFFFFF. A rule would be generated that would specify that for reads, only the subset x00000000 to x5FFFFFFF were to be output as transactions, and the rest were to be excluded. For writes, only the subset x60000000 to x8FFFFFFF would be output as transactions. 
     In simple cases, it could be more efficient to simply limit a range, without generating rules. Typically, however, when a rule involves more than one parameter as in the above example (read, write, and corresponding ranges), a rule or rules are inserted into the syntax rather than a simple reduction of the parameter specification. Rules are more versatile in that they can specify interdependencies of parameters in the rules. 
     A description of a possible embodiment of the syntax used for the bus architecture file  100  and DUT configuration file  102  follows. Comments are indicated by “l/”. It is noted that the form of the syntactical statements described is arbitrary and merely representative of functionality which could be implemented in a wide variety of symbolic formulations suitable for being parsed by a parsing routine. 
     configuration [name] 
     This syntactical statement specifies a bus architecture type. Each bus architecture is characterized by a set of transactions, and typically a subset of those transactions constitutes an interface with a given DUT. 
     path [device_path] 
     This syntactical statement specifies a logical path in a testing system hierarchy to a device or software entity, such as a BFM, that is used to apply a test case to a DUT. 
     device_type[name] 
     This syntactical statement specifies a type of device in a given bus architecture, such as a slave, master or arbiter, used to apply a test case to a DUT. 
     iterations [integer] 
     This syntactical statement specifies a maximum number of bus transactions a user wishes the generator to output to an output file. If this statement is not included in the configuration file, then the generator will simply output all possible bus transactions (depending on rule specifications) corresponding to parameter definitions in the configuration file. 
     file_size [integer] 
     This syntactical statement specifies a maximum number of bus transactions for the generator to output per file. When the maximum number is reached, the generator creates a new output file and begins outputting to the new output file. 
     traverse [1 or 0] 
     This syntactical statement allows a user to direct the generator to continue enumerating bus transactions once a maximum number specified by the iterations statement, for example, has been reached, but without outputting the transactions to an output file. 
     trans_type 
     [command1] [command2] [command3] . . . 
     end_trans_type 
     This syntactical statement specifies bus transaction types (“command”). Examples include “read” and “write”. The generator will generate bus transactions of the transaction types and including parameter combinations as determined by a command statement, discussed below. 
     generate 
     // specification of a list of transaction types 
     list [command1] [command2] [command3] . . . 
     // specification of an integer=n, where n is a number of transaction types to be selected at random from the trans_type list 
     uniform [integer] 
     end generate 
     This syntactical statement specifies a way in which bus transaction types are generated by the generator program. In the list format, a user lists transaction types. The generator will generate all the possible combinations of the listed transaction types, along with associated parameters as specified by the command statement described below. 
     An alternative format for the generate syntactical statement is to specify the keyword uniform followed by an integer. This format will cause the specified integer number of transaction types to be selected at random from the list set forth in the trans_type statement. 
     passthrough [pregen or postgen] [all or number] 
     [Initialization/Termination command1] 
     [Initialization/Termination command2] 
     end passthrough 
     This syntactical statement allows the user to specify initialization or termination commands for being included in a test case. The initialization or termination commands are not processed by the generator, but are instead simply “passed through” directly to the generator output file. The pregen keyword causes initialization commands to be inserted ahead of generated bus transactions, while the postgen keyword causes termination commands to be inserted after generated bus transactions. The parameter all may be specified to have the pregen or postgen commands passed to all test cases, or a particular test case may be specified by number to receive pregen or postgen commands. 
     command 
     //for an enumerated list 
     [parameter name] [enum] [item1][item2] [item3] . . . 
     // for a range of values, or a uniform random distribution within a range 
     [parameter name] [uniform or range] [min_value][max_value] [step][step_value] 
     // for type range: step and step_value are optional 
     end command 
     This syntactical statement allows a user to specify all of the parameters, and all of the possible parameter values for each parameter, that are valid for a given bus architecture. 
     Following the command identifier are parameter combination specifications. Possible formats for specifying parameter combinations include enum, uniform, and range, as shown. For parameter combination specifications of type enum, the parameter values follow the keyword enum in the form of an enumeration list. As discussed in greater detail below, when the generator processes a parameter combination specification of the enum type, it will combine each of the listed parameter values with other parameter specifications of the command statement using an enumeration routine. Depending upon applied rules, the generator will output the combinations, typically in the form of bus transactions, to an output file. 
     For parameter combination specifications of type uniform and range, a user specifies minimum (min_value) and maximum (max_value) values following the corresponding keyword. For specifications of type uniform, the generator will choose a random value between the minimum and maximum values when generating parameter combinations. 
     For specifications of type range, a user may choose a step value or increment between the minimum and maximum values. This is accomplished through the use of the step keyword followed by a value indicating the step value (step_value). When processing parameter combination specifications of type range, the generator sets the parameter to the minimum range value and then increments the value by the specified step value to generate parameter combinations. The step and step value keywords are optional. If step and step_value are not included within the parameter combination specification, then the step_value defaults to 1 and all possible values within the minimum and maximum values are generated. 
     Different formats may be used for range and uniform specifications, including decimal, binary, and hexadecimal. To specify a format, special characters may be included before the min_value and max_value keywords. Hexadecimal may be chosen by including an “x” character and binary by including a “b”. Preferably, decimal is the default. 
     Examples: x10 // hexadecimal value, equal to 16 decimal 
     b10 // binary value, equal to 2 decimal 
     10 // decimal value 
     rule [include or exclude] [rule_name] // optional rule specifications 
     [eq or ne] [parameter name] [item 1] [item2] [item3] 
     [lt or gt] [parameter name] [value] 
     [eq or ne] [parameter name] [mask] [mask_value] [value] [test_value] 
     end_rule 
     This syntactical statement allows a user to restrict the total set of bus transactions generated, as defined by the command specifications, to possible subsets for output. Rules may specify the actions exclude or include to exclude or include, respectively, a combination of parameters and parameter values for the bus transactions, based upon the results of tests specified by the user. The tests include different types of relational operators, such as: equal (eq), not equal (ne), less than (lt), or greater than (gt). 
     In the first format shown above for specifying a test (the line reading [eq or ne] [parameter name] [item 1] [item2] [item3]), each combination of a list item ([item 1], [item2], or [item3]) with [parameter name] is compared to a generated combination using the specified relational operator [eq or ne]. Each test returns a true condition or a false condition. 
     In the second format shown (the line reading [lt or gt] [parameter name] [value]), [parameter name] is compared with [value] using the specified relational [lt or gt]. Each test returns a true condition or a false condition. 
     In the third format shown, tests may be specified using a mask format. With the mask format, the value specification is masked with the mask_value specification. The result is then tested against test_value using the appropriate relational operator [eq or ne]. 
     If all the tests specified in a rule return a true condition, then the specified action is performed. That is, if all tests return a true condition and the rule specifies include, the parameter combination is included in the generator output file. If the rule specifies exclude, the parameter combination is not output to the output file. 
     If any test returns a false condition, then the action opposite to the action specified is performed. That is, if any test returns a false condition and the action specified is include, the parameter combination is excluded from the output file. If the action specified is exclude, the parameter combination is included in the output file. 
     If more than one rule is stated in a configuration file, a first logical AND operation is performed with the conditions returned by evaluating all the tests specified for exclude actions. A logical OR operation is performed with the conditions returned by evaluating all the tests specified for include actions. 
     Then, a second logical AND operation is performed with results of the first logical AND and the logical OR operations. The second logical AND operation returns a true or false condition to determine whether to include the parameter combination or combinations for which rules are specified. 
     If no rules are included in a configuration file, all the parameter combinations corresponding to the command statement specification are generated or enumerated. As described above, the iterations statement may limit the number of transactions output to the output file. 
     rule [NA] [parameter name] (optional) 
     [eq or, ne] [parameter name] [item1] [item2] [item3] 
     [lt or gt] [parameter name] [value] 
     [eq or ne] [parameter name] [mask] [mask_value] [value] [test_value] 
     end_rule 
     This syntactical statement allows for the omitting of certain parameters under specific conditions during test case generation. The tests under the NA (Not Applicable) formulation use relational operators as in the include/exclude rules described above. 
     In order for a parameter to be evaluated as Not Applicable and therefore excluded from the generator output, all the tests specified must return a true condition. If this true condition occurs, the parameter name specified in [parameter name] is excluded from a currently selected list of parameter values generated by the generator. The NA formulation for a rule serves to filter single parameters located within the currently selected list. 
     end_configuration 
     This syntactical statement denotes the ending of the configuration file. 
     FIG. 4 shows a process flow for the generator  104 , given a configuration file  102  specified in the above-described syntax as input. As shown in block  400 , initially the generator parses the configuration file and initializes parameter values. All range specifications are set to their respective lower limits, or min values, and all enumeration lists are set to their first listed item. 
     In order to systematically enumerate each possible parameter combination, the generator assigns a significance level to each parameter combination specification in a command statement, based on its place in a sequence within the command statement. In an embodiment, the parameter combination specification last in the sequence is the least significant, the next-to-last parameter combination specification is next-to-least significant, and so on up to the first or most significant specification in the sequence. 
     As shown in block  401 , enumeration or generation of parameter combinations begins with the level of least significance (initially the “next” significance level is the least significant level). As shown in block  402 , the generator combines parameter values at each significance level, at their current state, to form a parameter combination. 
     As each parameter combination in the command statement is generated, it is checked against any rules which may be defined in the configuration file, as shown in block  403 . If the generated parameter combination is not excluded by a rule, the generator checks for whether an iterations limit as specified in an iterations statement as described above has been reached, as shown in block  404 . If the combination is excluded by a rule, the flow proceeds to block  407 . 
     If an iterations limit has been reached, as shown in block  405  the generator checks for whether to keep traversing the command structure to form parameter combinations, but without outputting them, as specified in the traverse statement described above. If traverse has not been set to “1”, the generator stops. Otherwise, the flow proceeds to block  407 . 
     If an iterations limit has not been reached, the parameter combination is output to an output file, typically in the form of a bus transaction, as shown in block  406 . 
     At block  407 , the generator checks for whether an upper limit of a specified range has been reached within the current significance level. In the case of an enumeration list, the generator checks for whether all items of the list have been visited or traversed. 
     As shown in block  408 , if within the current significance level the upper limit of a range has not been reached or all the items of an enumeration list have not been traversed, the parameter value of the range is updated (by step value if specified or by 1 if not) or the next list item is fetched or visited. Then, the resulting parameter combination is checked against the rules, if any. 
     When the upper limit of a range is reached or all list items of an enumeration list have been traversed, the generator moves up to the next significance level. As shown in block  409 , if all significance levels have been processed, the generator is finished and exits. If not, as shown in block  410  the generator resets all levels of lesser significance than the next level to be processed to their initial values, i.e., to the lower limit of a range or to the first item in an enumeration list, and processes the next level. 
     It may be observed that the foregoing resembles the functioning of a mileage odometer, in that digits of an odometer, corresponding to significance levels in the above, run through all possible values, beginning with the least significant digit. 
     The following is an illustrative example of the foregoing enumeration process: 
     command 
     address range x0A x0C 
     // The above is a command statement in the configuration file syntax. The first and // most significant parameter combination specification is a range type of // specification for parameter name=address. The lower limit or min_value for the // range is x0A, and the upper limit or max_value is x0C. No step value is specified, // so beginning with the lower limit, the range will be incremented by the default step // value which is 1; 
     be enum 000 111 
     // The above is an enum or enumeration list type of parameter combination 
     // specification for parameter name=be (byte enable) comprising two list items, 000 // and 111. This is the least significant parameter combination specification in the // command statement; 
     end_command 
     From the above command specification, the generator would produce the following parameter combinations: 
     address=0A, be=000 
     address=0A, be=111 
     address=0B, be=000 
     address=0B, be=111 
     address=0C, be=000 
     address=0C, be=111 
     As can be seen, the generator traversed the least significant level first, pairing each list value with the initial range value, 0A, of the next significance level. Then, the next significance level was processed. The range value was incremented to 0B, the level of lower significance was reset to its initial value, and the generator produced the next possible combinations. Finally, the upper limit, 0C, of the most significant level was reached and each combination at that level was generated. 
     The following is an example of application of a rule in a configuration file to the above-described command definition: 
     rule exclude 
     eq address x0C 
     eq be 111 
     end_rule 
     In the above rule specification, the specified tests are that if a parameter combination having an address equal (eq) to x0C and a “be” parameter equal to 111 is generated, the combination is to be excluded from the generator output. Thus, if this rule was present in the configuration file with the above command definition, the generator would produce the following output: 
     address=0A, be=000 
     address=0A, be=111 
     address=0B, be=000 
     address=0B, be=111 
     address=0C, be=000 
     It can be seen that, because both tests returned a true condition for the parameter combination “address=0C, be=111”, this combination was excluded from the generator output. 
     The following is another example of a configuration file and resulting generator output: 
     
       
         
               
             
                   
               
                 Configuration file: 
               
                 configuration plb_device 
               
                 // The bus is a plb processor local bus); 
               
                 path /plb_complex/m0/master 
               
                 device_type plb_master

                 // Transaction types are “read” and “write”;

                 // uniform[integer] were specified instead, the generator would

     As noted above, the foregoing syntax may be used for the bus architecture file  100  and the DUT configuration file  102 . More particularly, the user selection process  101  tailors or customizes the syntax of the bus architecture file  100  to the syntax of the DUT configuration file  102 . 
     In order to describe a possible embodiment of the invention for implementing the user selection process  101  described above, an example of a generic table entry of the table configuration file  103  is shown below. Elements of the table entry are represented as generic variable names (e.g., “type_possible”) which may assume specific values assigned by a user or by software implementing the user interface based on information provided in the input bus architecture and table configuration files. The user interface parses assigned values in the table entry to produce a DUT configuration file.

     Line 1 of the above generic table entry would be used to specify a table entry type, for example, “range”, “enum” or the like, which would typically correspond to a format of the command statement in the configuration file syntax. A table entry type might also be “select” or “active”. A “select” type of table entry provides for a single value of a group of possible values to be assigned to an entry variable, as opposed to, for example, an “enum” type which allows multiple values to be assigned. An “active” entry type provides status information on the entry to the interface. A name of the table entry could also be included in line 1. Line 1 further provides for the specification of a level of the entry in a table hierarchy. Entries lower in the hierarchy are dependent on entries higher in the hierarchy. When table_level is not specified or is “0”, the entry is independent. 
     Line 2 of the generic table entry would have values associated with it that are used by the interface to determine whether an entry is “active” or not. An entry that depends on a higher-level entry is inactive when the higher-level entry is inactive. When the interface parses updated table entries to produce the DUT configuration file, this information tells the interface whether or not to process dependent entries; “type value” may be “yes” or “no” to specify whether or not a table entry is active; 
     Line 3 provides for an arbitrary label for the entry; 
     Line 4 provides a selection of possible parameter values to the user. 
     Line 5 contains the user-specified subset of the possible values. 
     Lines 6 and 7 allow for a mode of range enumeration to be specified, for example, uniform or step, and a step value to be specified if the mode selected is step. 
     Lines 9 through 12, delimited by “cmd_attr” on line 8 and “end_cmd_attr” on line 13, would be included in a command specification in the DUT configuration file, with “value” taking on values assigned by user and held in the “type_value” field; rules for insertion into the DUT configuration file are also delimited by “cmd_attr” and “end_cmd_attr”. 
     Line 14 denotes the end of the table entry. 
     Below is a first example of a table entry in which the generic variable names described above have been evaluated or assigned specific values from information in the bus architecture and table configuration files, but before a user has changed or updated the entry: 
     EXAMPLE 1 
     
       
         
               
             
                   
               
                 table_range address 
               
                 // “type” is “range”; “name_of entry” is “address”; 
               
                  range_label “Address Range(hexadecimal)” 
               
                 // “title_of_entry“ is “Address Range(hexadecimal)” 
               
                  range_value x00000000 xFFFFFFFF 
               
                 // “type” is “range” , so “value” is specified as a range, in this case 
               
                 the default range of the 
               
                 // bus architecture; 
               
                  range_type step 
               
                  range_step 1 
               
                  cmd_attr 
               
                   addr range value_0 value_1 
               
                 // This portion of the table entry corresponds to an actual command 
               
                 // specification; “value_0 value_1” would have the values 
               
                 “x00000000 xFFFFFFFF” 
               
                 // specified in the “range value” line above, assuming no user override; 
               
                  end_cmd_attr 
               
                 end_range 
               
                   
               
           
              
             
             
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
             
          
         
       
     
     As described above, the foregoing table entries may be updated by a user via the user interface. For instance, if a user changes the address range in the Example 1 entry above to x00000000 through x11111111, then the first entry will be updated to the following: 
     
       
         
               
               
             
                   
                   
               
                   
                 table_range address 
               
                   
                  range_label “Address Range(hexadecimal)” 
               
                   
                  range_value x00000000 x11111111 
               
                   
                  range_type step 
               
                   
                  range_step 1 
               
                   
                  cmd_attr 
               
                   
                   addr range value_0 value_1 
               
                   
                  end_cmd_attr 
               
                   
                 end_range 
               
                   
                   
               
           
              
             
             
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
             
          
         
       
     
     It should be noted that the upper address value in the range_value field has been changed. 
     Below is a second example showing two table entries, with the second table entry dependent on the first. The generic variable names described above have been evaluated or assigned specific values from information in the bus architecture and table configuration files, but before a user has updated the entry. Note that, depending on the type of table entry, certain fields of the generic entry discussed above are unnecessary. The first entry shown below, for example, is a zero-level entry and thus requires no “type_off” field: 
     EXAMPLE 2 
     
       
         
               
             
                   
               
                 table_active single_xfer 
               
                 // “type” is “active” ; the name of the table entry is “single_xfer; 
               
                  active_label “Single Transfers” 
               
                  active_value yes 
               
                 // Since “active_value” is initially assigned a value of “yes”, table entries 
               
                 dependent on 
               
                 // this table entry will be parsed by the interface. A user may change 
               
                 “active_value” to 
               
                 // “no” , which would tell the interface to bypass dependent entries; 
               
                  cmd_attr yes

     As in Example 1, values in the above table entries could changed by user inputs. For example, “active_value” in the “table_active single_xfer” entry first in the hierarchy could be changed from “yes” to “no”, causing the interface to skip the dependent entry, “table_range single 1”, when parsing the entries to produce a DUT configuration file. Or, for example, a user could change the upper range of “range_value” to “b0011”, which would cause “value high” in the “cmd_attr” sections to have the value b0011. 
     When the user has made changes to table entries as described above, and saves or registers the changes via the user interface software, the changed entries are used to determine the values that are placed in the command section of the DUT configuration file. In addition, the changed values in the entries are used to determine which rules will be placed in the DUT configuration file. This is done by comparing the user selections to values in the “cmd_attr” field, and then including the rules that follow accordingly. Cmd_attr fields corresponding to user selections will be parsed to include the parameter combination specifications in the command section of the configuration file, while “exclude” rules for these parameter combinations will not be included. In contrast, non-selected cmd_attr fields will be parsed to insert “exclude” rules for corresponding parameter combinations in the command section. 
     A third example, describing user selections and the corresponding generation of rules in two table entries, is shown below. The two table entries are named “burst_xfer” and “burst_width”, respectively; the “burst_width” entry is dependent on the “burst_xfer” entry.

     Shown below is pseudo-code describing a routine executed by the user interface to parse user inputs and produce command and rule specifications for the DUT configuration file. Generally, the routine traverses the table entry hierarchy to find active entries. For active entries within each level of the hierarchy, the routine reads values set in the table entry and holds them in a list to be used to build the command and rule specifications. In building the command and rule specifications, the routine parses the cmd_attr section of the table entry and appends rules with associated parameters.

       [0001] The present invention relates generally to a hybrid-type electric vehicle. More particularly, the invention relates to an electric rotary machine for driving the hybrid drive type vehicle and generating an electric power, and a control method therefor. Further particularly, the invention relates to an electric rotary machine, in which a rotor of the electric rotary machine is constructed with a first field magnet and a second field magnet, and which is variable of effective flex amount depending upon a direction of torque.  
       DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART  
       [0002] As a conventional hybrid drive type vehicle, there are (1) a series hybrid type driving a generator by an output torque of an engine as an internal combustion engine for obtaining an electric power and driving a electric rotary machine connected to a wheel axle by the electric power for driving a vehicle by a driving torque generated by the electric rotary machine, and (2) a parallel hybrid type, in which a part of the output torque of the engine is converted into an electric power and remaining output torque is transmitted to the wheel axle as driving torque for driving the vehicle by a driving torque of the electric rotary machine using the generated electric power and the wheel axle driving torque of the engine.  
       [0003] In the recent trend, in view point of sizes and costs for the motor and/or battery, attention is attracted to (2) the parallel hybrid driving type vehicle. For example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-132042 (1997), a parallel hybrid drive type vehicle of the type wherein the engine and two electric rotary machines are connected to respective shafts of a planetary gear mechanism and a driving force is distributed depending upon load and revolution speed of the engine and respective electric rotary machines (this type will be hereinafter referred to as “two motor system”), has already marketed.  
       [0004] However, such prior art requires two electric rotary machines and two inverter circuits for driving the electric rotary machines and newly arranging the planetary gear mechanism and thus requires significant reconstruction of the vehicle to cause significant increase of the cost associating therewith.  
       [0005] Therefore, as shown in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-298696 (1995), there has been proposed a system, in which an electric rotary machine is directly connected to a crankshaft of the engine for switching driving mode and generating mode in one electric rotary machine (this system will be referred to as “single motor system”). This single electric rotary machine system is advantageous in view point of cost and capability of add-on the existing vehicle.  
       [0006] In both of single motor system and two motor system, as the electric rotary machine, a permanent magnet field type electric rotary machine arranged a permanent magnet on a rotor or a squirrel cage induction electric rotary machine, in which a secondary conductors made of aluminum alloy or copper alloy are arranged on the rotor in cage-like fashion, may be employed.  
       [0007] As set forth above, the single motor system is more advantageous than the two motor systems in viewpoint of the cost. However, the following constraints are present even in the single motor system.  
       [0008] (1) It has to be achieved both of a high torque characteristics in low revolution speed range upon starting-up of the engine and high-power generation characteristics in high revolution speed range.  
       [0009] (2) A revolution speed to generate a torque (maximum torque to be generated by the motor) upon starting-up of the engine is less than or equal to one tenth for a motor revolution speed at the allowable maximum revolution speed of the engine.  
       [0010] (3) The present invention is directed to the electric rotary machine mounted on the vehicle, and as a power source, a battery charging and discharging within a voltage variation range centered at a certain voltage, is employed. Therefore, if a voltage far beyond a charging voltage of the battery is charged, it is possible to damage the battery in the worst case.  
       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  
       [0011] The present invention has been worked out in view of the shortcoming in the prior art as set forth above. It is therefore an object to provide a hybrid drive type vehicle having a permanent magnet type synchronous motor obtainable of high torque characteristics in low revolution speed range of the engine and high power generation characteristics at high revolution speed range of the engine.  
       [0012] According to one aspect of the present invention, a hybrid drive type vehicle comprises:  
       [0013] an internal combustion engine driving a vehicle;  
       [0014] a battery charging and discharging an electric power;  
       [0015] an electric rotary machine mechanically connected with a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine for starting up the internal combustion engine as driven by the electric power supplied from the battery, and driven by revolution of the internal combustion engine for performing generation for charging the battery;  
       [0016] an inverter for controlling driving and generating of the electric rotary machine;  
       [0017] a controller controlling the inverter;  
       [0018] revolution speed detecting means for detecting a revolution speed of the internal combustion engine or the electric rotary machine;  
       [0019] the electric rotary machine being formed with a stator having a primary winding and a rotor having a field magnet, the field magnet being constituted of a first field magnet alternately arranged mutually opposite magnetic poles in sequentially in circumferential direction and a second field magnet capable of causing relative angular displacement relative to the first field magnet and alternately arranged mutually opposite magnetic poles in sequentially in circumferential direction, the first and second field magnets being opposing with a magnetic pole of the stator and having a mechanism for varying a phase of a magnetic pofe resulting from combination of the first and second field magnets relative to the magnetic pole of the first field magnet depending upon direction of a torque of the rotor,  
       [0020] the mechanism for varying the magnetic pole depending upon the direction of the torque including means for aligning centers of the same magnetic poles of the first and second field magnets by balance between torque direction generated in the rotor and magnetic action between the first and second magnetic and means for causing offset of the center of the same magnet poles of the first and second field magnetic associating with generation of the torque generated in the rotor in the opposite direction.  
       [0021] Operation of one aspect of the invention as set forth above will be discussed.  
       [0022] In FIG. 6, the characteristics of an effective flux relative to a rotational angular velocity of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine, an induced electromotive force, and a terminal voltage are shown.  
       [0023] An induced electromotive force E o  of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine is determined by a constant magnetic flux Φ generated by the permanent magnet and rotational angular velocity ω of the electric rotary machine. Namely, as shown in FIG. 6, when the rotational angular velocity ω of the electric rotary machine (revolution speed) is increased, the induced electromotive force E o  of the electric rotary machine is proportionally increased. However, as an essential condition in mounting on the vehicle is charging of the battery. In order to charge the battery, the induced electromotive force to be generated in the electric rotary machine has to be suppressed to be lower than or equal to a battery charge voltage so as not to damage the battery. Therefore, in the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine, it requires to perform weakening field control for reducing magnetic flux generated by the permanent magnet in range of the revolution speed higher than or equal to a predetermined value.  
       [0024] Since the induced electromotive force is increased in proportion to the rotational angular velocity, current for weakening field control has to be increased. Therefore, a large current has to flow through the coil as the primary winding to inherently cause heating of the coil. Therefore, efficiency of the electric rotary machine is lowered in the high revolution speed range to possibly cause demagnetization or so forth of the permanent magnet due to heating beyond cooling capacity.  
       [0025] Therefore, according to one aspect of the present invention, the first field magnet and the second field magnet of the rotor of the electric rotary machine are arranged coaxially for varying the centers of the magnetic poles of the first and second field magnets depending upon the direction of the rotational torque so that the centers of the same magnetic poles of the first and second field magnets are aligned upon serving as an electric motor in the low revolution speed range, such as upon starting up of the engine or the like to provide large effective flux amount by the permanent magnet opposing to the magnetic poles of the stator to attain high torque. Next, upon serving as the generator, when the rotating direction of the rotor is the same, the torque to be applied to the rotor becomes opposite to that applied upon serving as the electric motor to cause offset of the centers of the same magnetic poles of the first and second field magnets to reduce effective flux amount by the permanent magnet opposing the magnetic poles of the stator to attain weakening field effect to obtain high power generation characteristics in high revolution speed range.  
       [0026] In the preferred construction, the electric rotary machine serves as an electric motor at low revolution speed range and having means for aligning centers of the same magnetic poles of the first and second field magnets by balance between torque direction generated in the rotor and magnetic action between the first and second magnetic, and serves as a generator at high revolution speed range and having means for causing offset of the center of the same magnet poles of the first and second field magnetic associating with generation of the torque generated in the rotor in the opposite direction. Also, the electric rotary machine serves as an electric motor at low revolution speed range and having means for aligning the first and second field magnets at an initial position by balance between torque direction generated in the rotor and magnetic action between the first and second magnetic, and serves as a generator at high revolution speed range and having means for causing offset of the center of the same magnet poles of the first and second field magnetic associating with generation of the torque generated in the rotor in the opposite direction, and the mechanism for varying the center of the magnetic pole associating with variation of the torque direction is constructed by rigidly securing the first magnet on a shaft and separating the second field magnet from the shaft, and the shaft and the second field magnet are permitted to cause relative angular offset within an angular range corresponding to circumferential length of one magnetic pole for causing offset of the center of the poles of the first field magnet and the center of the poles of the second field magnet. A stopper may be provided at a position away from the side surface of the second field magnet. A serve mechanism may be provided for displacing the stopper in parallel to the shaft depending upon revolution speed.  
       [0027] According to another aspect of the present invention, an electric rotary machine comprises:  
       [0028] a stator having a primary winding and a rotor having a field magnet, the field magnet being constituted of a first field magnet alternately arranged mutually opposite magnetic poles in sequentially in circumferential direction and a second field magnet capable of causing relative angular displacement relative to the first field magnet and alternately arranged mutually opposite magnetic poles in sequentially in circumferential direction, the first and second field magnets being opposing with a magnetic pole of the stator and having a mechanism for varying a phase of a magnetic pole resulting from combination of the first and second field magnets relative to the magnetic pole of the first field magnet depending upon direction of a torque of the rotor,  
       [0029] the mechanism for varying the magnetic pole depending upon the direction of the torque including means for aligning centers of the same magnetic poles of the first and second field magnets by balance between torque direction generated in the rotor and magnetic action between the first and second magnetic and means for causing offset of the center of the same magnet poles of the first and second field magnetic associating with generation of the torque generated in the rotor in the opposite direction.  
       [0030] The mechanism for varying the center of the magnetic pole associating with variation of the torque direction may be constructed by rigidly securing the first magnet on a shaft and separating the second field magnet from the shaft, and the shaft is formed with a threaded portion serving as a bolt and an inner periphery of the second field magnet being formed with a thread for serving as a nut for connection in thread engagement, and a stopper is provided at a position away from the side surface of the second field magnet, and a serve mechanism for displacing the stopper in parallel to the shaft depending upon revolution speed.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  
     [0045] The present invention will be discussed hereinafter in detail in terms of the preferred embodiment of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be obvious, however, to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instance, well-known structure are not shown in detail in order to avoid unnecessary obscurity of the present invention.  
     [0046]FIGS. 1A and 1B show a layout of the preferred embodiment of a permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine (direct connection type) according to the present invention. The preferred embodiment of a permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  is arranged between an engine  1  as an internal combustion engine for generating a driving force of a vehicle and a power transmission  3  of the vehicle. A crankshaft (not shown) of the engine  1  and a shaft (shaft  22  of a rotor in FIG. 2) of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  are connected directly or mechanically via a speed changer constructed by a planetary gear speed reducer.  
     [0047] On the other hand, the shaft of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  and an input shaft of the power transmission  3  are directly connected via a clutch (not shown) or a torque converter (not shown) as a fluid coupling shutting off a driving force.  
     [0048] By constructing as set forth above, by operating the clutch or torque converter, the shown embodiment of the permanent magnetic type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  can start-up the engine  1 . After starting up the engine  1 , by operating the clutch and the torque converter, a driving force of the engine  1  can be transmitted to the input shaft of the power transmission  3 . In conjunction therewith, driving forces of the engine  1  and the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  are transmitted to the input shaft of the power transmission  3 .  
     [0049] On the other hand, the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  is electrically connected to a battery  5  via an inverter  4  for serving as an electric motor as assisting starting up of the engine  1 .  
     [0050] Upon power generation, an electric force generated in the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  is converted into a direct current by the inverter  4  for charging the battery  5 .  
     [0051]FIG. 2 shows general construction showing the case where a center of the same pole of the rotor of the electric rotary machine of FIG. 1 is offset. On an iron core  10  of a stator, armature coils  11  are coiled within slots. The iron core  10  of the stator is shrink-fitted in a housing  13  which is formed with a cooling water passage  12  for flowing a cooling water therein. Here, securing method of the stator iron core  10  and the housing  13  is not limited to shrink-fitting but can be pressure fitting or so forth.  
     [0052] A permanent magnet embedded type rotor  20  is formed with a first rotor  20 A fixed on the shaft  22  and a second rotor  20 B separated from the shaft  22 . Of course, the rotor can be not only the permanent magnet embedded type rotor but also a surface magnet type rotor.  
     [0053] On the first rotor  20 A, permanent magnets  21 A having magnetic poles of alternate polarities are arranged in circumferential direction. Similarly, on the second rotor  20 B, permanent magnets  21 B having magnetic poles of alternate polarities are arranged in circumferential direction. Field magnets of the first and second rotors are opposed to magnetic poles of the stator.  
     [0054] Inner periphery of the second rotor  20 B is threaded to form a nut, and a corresponding portion of the shaft is also threaded to form a bolt for permitting mutual engagement between the second rotor  20 B and the shaft by thread engagement.  
     [0055] On the other hand, for preventing the second rotor  20 B from offsetting beyond a predetermined displacement magnitude from the center of the stator, a stopper  24  is provided at a position away from a side surface of the second rotor  20 B. Furthermore, a stopper driving actuator  25  serving a servo mechanism is provided for shifting the stopper  24  in axial direction in parallel to the shaft for controlling effective flux amount depending upon rotation speed.  
     [0056] By constructing as set forth above, the effective magnetic flux amount of the permanent magnet can be varied depending upon direction of the torque.  
     [0057] Basically, in the electric rotary machine having the armature coil on the stator and the permanent magnet on the rotor, when the rotating direction of the rotor is the same either upon acting as the electric motor or as the generator, torques to be applied to the rotor is in the opposite direction upon acting as the electric motor or as the generator.  
     [0058] When the basic theory set forth above is applied to the preferred embodiment of the electric rotary machine according to the present invention, the following effects can be obtained.  
     [0059] When the electric rotary machine is operated as the electric motor at low revolution speed range, such as starting up of the engine or the like, the centers of the same magnetic pole of the first rotor  20 A and the second rotor  20 B are aligned to make the effective flux amount of the permanent magnet opposing the magnetic pole of the stator maximum to obtain high torque characteristics, as shown in FIG. 3.  
     [0060] Next, upon acting as the generator, when the rotating directions of the rotors are the same, directions of the torques to be applied to the rotors are opposite to the case acting as the electric motor. Then the second rotor  20 B is rotated relative to the shaft  22  in loosening direction to move away from the first rotor  20 A to widen a distance between the first rotor  20 A and the second rotor  20 B to cause offset of the center of the same poles to reduce effective flux amount of the permanent magnet opposing the magnetic pole of the stator. Thus, field weakening effect can be achieved to obtain high power generation characteristics in the high revolution speed range.  
     [0061]FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a power source system of the electric rotary machine of FIG. 1.  
     [0062] Three-phase terminal of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  mechanically connected to the engine  1 , is electrically connected to the inverter  4 . A direct current side terminal of the inverter  4  is connected to the battery  5  and to other high voltage system. On the other hand, in the shown embodiment, low voltage system for a head lamp, audio and so forth is provided. Power supply for the low voltage system is performed by lowering the voltage from the high voltage system by DC-DC converter  30  for supplying to a low voltage battery  9  and other low voltage drive devices (head lamp, audio and so forth). Depending upon drive mode of the vehicle, the permanent magnetic type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  is switched between driving mode and generating mode. Switching of mode and supplying of a command value to the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  is performed by performing arithmetic operation and judgment by a controller  11  for outputting the command value to the inverter  4  for controlling the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2 . On the other hand, a controller  31  performs cooperative control of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  and the engine  1  by making the command value output to the inverter  4  common with an engine controller  32  controlling a throttle valve open degree, fuel injection amount and so forth of the engine through communication, direct memory access or so forth.  
     [0063] Next, discussion will be given for control performed in the controller  31 .  
     [0064]FIG. 5 is a block diagram showing a control system for the electric rotary machine of FIG. 1.  
     [0065] At first, on the basis of information (battery remaining capacity, drive mode, throttle valve open degree and so forth) from the engine controller ( 32  of FIG. 4) and independently installed sensor and revolution speed of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2 , a driving condition judging portion  201  makes judgment of driving operation of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  to output a current command value. The current command value output from the driving condition judging portion  201  is input to a current control block  203  performing anti-interference control or so forth with reference to a difference with an instantaneous current value of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  through a PID compensation block  202 .  
     [0066] Output of the current control block  203  is converted into a three-phase alternating current to control the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  via the inverter. On the other hand, the currents of respective phases (currents of at least two phases) of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  and revolution speed (or engine revolution speed, or in the alternative, multiplied value of the engine revolution speed) are detected. The current in each phase is converted into a biaxial current by a biaxial converter block  205  for feeding back to the current command value. On the other hand, the revolution speed is input to the driving condition judging portion  201  to be information for judgment of driving condition.  
     [0067]FIG. 7 shows another embodiment of the electric rotary machine according to the present invention.  
     [0068] The shown embodiment is characterized by a mechanism permitting angular displacement of the second rotor for angle θ instead of providing the thread  23  in the second rotor shown in FIG. 2.  
     [0069]FIG. 8 is general illustration of the rotor of the electric rotary machine of FIG. 7.  
     [0070] In place of the threaded portion of the second rotor shown in FIG. 2, a gear teeth like toothing is provided on the shaft  22  and complementary toothing is formed on the inner periphery of the second rotor  20 B for engagement with the shaft. The pitch of the teeth is greater than the width of the teeth so that the shaft inserted into the second rotor  20 B is permitted to cause relative angular displacement for the predetermined angle θ. Furthermore, by disposing a spring  26  and a dumper  27  between mating teeth and groove for damping abrupt collision.  
     [0071]FIG. 9 shows a layout of the electric rotary machine and the engine of another embodiment of the present invention (transverse type). The engine  1  and the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  are connected by a metal belt  7  wound around a crank pulley  6  and a pulley  8  rigidly secured on the shaft of the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2 . It should be appreciated that the crank pulley  6  and the pulley  8  may also be connected by a chain, cogged belt and the like. Also, in place of the crank pulley  6  and the pulley  8 , a gear may also be used.  
     [0072] Advantage of the construction as illustrated in FIG. 9 is presence of a speed change mechanism having a speed ratio between the engine  1  and the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  by the crank pulley  6 , the metal belt  7  and the pulley  8  interposed between the engine  1  and the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2 . For example, by setting the radius ratio of the crank pulley  6  and the pulley  8  at 2:1, the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  is driven at a speed double of the engine  1 . Associating with this, upon starting up of the engine  1 , the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  is required to generate a half of the torque required for starting up of the engine  1 . Therefore, it becomes possible to form the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine  2  compact. Other electrical connection and function are the same as those discussed in connection with FIG. 5.  
     [0073] The permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine according to the present invention is constructed by dividing the rotor into the first field magnet and the second field magnet arranged coaxially and for varying the center of the magnetic poles of the first and second field magnets to vary the effective flux amount by the permanent magnet opposing to the stator magnetic pole.

Therefore, the present invention should not be understood as limited to the specific embodiment set out above but to include all possible embodiments which can be embodied within a scope encompassed and equivalent thereof with respect to the feature set out in the appended claims.

For example, FIG. 10 shows the case where the present invention is applied for the permanent magnet type synchronous electric rotary machine having eight magnets.

     FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention generally relates to an absorbent article, and more particularly to a disposable absorbent garment, such as a taped diaper or training pant, comprising absorbent particulate polymer material. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Absorbent articles, such as disposable diapers, training pants, and adult incontinence undergarments, absorb and contain body exudates. 
     Fecal material is often difficult to remove from the skin of the user (e.g., wearer) of the absorbent article, in particular on sensitive skin such as that of young babies. Moreover, it is known that fecal material on the skin can cause irritation and redness of the skin and sometimes even dermatitis. Hence it desirable to reduce the fecal material on the skin, to provide a means to isolate the fecal material immediately after discharge, away from the skin. Conventional approaches toward this isolation include providing a diaper with a top sheet with one or more openings, through which the feces can pass for storage underneath this top sheet, away from the skin. However, this approach may not always be effective, particularly when the baby is in a sitting position or when the diaper is already highly urine-loaded, both of which diminish the void volume available to receive the feces. 
     There is also a desire to improve the comfort and fit of absorbent articles such as diapers, for example to make them thinner and more flexible while preserving or enhancing the article&#39;s ability to absorb and hold one or more gushes of liquid, to minimize uncontrolled bowel movement spreading, and to capture bowel movements so as to lead to cleaner skin for the wearer, with consequently less skin irritation and easier clean up. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention addresses one or more technical problems described above and provides a disposable absorbent article, which may comprise a chassis and an absorbent core, which may be substantially cellulose free. The chassis may include a top sheet and a back sheet. The absorbent core may be located between the top sheet and the back sheet and may comprise an absorbent particulate polymer material. The absorbent core includes at least one cavity, which may be defined at least about its perimeter by the absorbent particulate polymer material. The at least one cavity may be substantially free of the absorbent particulate polymer material. In one embodiment, the void volume of the cavity may be from about 2 ml to about 70 ml. 
     In one embodiment, the absorbent particulate polymer material present in the absorbent core may have a basis weight that varies across the absorbent core in a direction substantially perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis, in a direction substantially parallel to the central longitudinal axis, or in both directions. 
     In one embodiment, the disposable absorbent article may have a central longitudinal axis extending from a first end to a second end, and the at least one cavity may include (i) a first channel elongated in a direction substantially parallel to and located about the central longitudinal axis, and (ii) a second channel elongated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis. The first and second channels of the cavity together may form a T-shape. 
     In certain embodiments, the first channel may have a width from about 5% to about 60% of the width of the absorbent core and a length from about 2% to about 50% of the length of the absorbent core. The second channel may have a width from about 25% to about 90% of the width of the absorbent core and a length from about 2% to about 40% of the length of the absorbent core. In one embodiment, the first channel of the cavity may have a width between about 10 mm and about 40 mm, and a length between about 10 mm and about 130 mm. In another embodiment, the second channel of the cavity may have a width between about 30 mm and about 110 mm, and a length between about 10 mm and about 100 mm. Combinations of the first and second channels with these dimension ratios and values are contemplated. 
     In one embodiment, the absorbent core may comprise a core cover and a dusting layer adhered to one another about the periphery of the absorbent core to form an envelope about the absorbent particulate polymer materials to hold the absorbent particulate polymer material within the absorbent core. The core cover and the dusting layer may be adhered to one another about an area defining the bottom of the at least one cavity. 
     In one embodiment, the disposable absorbent article may further include an acquisition system located between the absorbent core and the top sheet. In one embodiment, the acquisition system may include an upper acquisition layer, which faces the top sheet, and a lower acquisition layer, which faces the absorbent core. In one case, the lower acquisition layer does not cover the at least one cavity. In one case, the upper acquisition layer does not completely cover the at least one cavity. The at least one cavity may further be defined about its perimeter by interior edges of an aperture in the acquisition system. 
     In a certain embodiment, the top sheet of the disposable absorbent article is an elasticized top sheet having at least one opening. At least a portion of the opening may be substantially aligned with the first channel of the cavity in the absorbent core. 
     In certain embodiments, the disposable absorbent article may be a diaper or a pant. In one example, the first channel of the cavity is located in the absorbent core along the central longitudinal axis of the diaper or pant at a position which, when the diaper or pant is worn by a wearer, will be in alignment with a predetermined region about the anus of the wearer. 
     In another aspect, a method is provided for making an absorbent core for use in a disposable absorbent article. The method may comprise depositing an absorbent particulate polymer material on a first substrate to form an absorbent core having a central longitudinal axis extending from a first end to a second end, such that the absorbent core is substantially cellulose free and comprises at least one cavity defined at least about its perimeter by the absorbent particulate polymer material. The at least one cavity may be substantially free of absorbent particulate polymer material. 
     In one embodiment, the step of depositing may comprise placing the first substrate on a porous forming surface and depositing the absorbent particulate polymer material to the substrate while applying a vacuum to the substrate through the porous forming surface. In one example, the forming surface may have recesses for receiving the substrate and the absorbent particulate polymer material and the recesses may be sized and arranged to vary the basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material across the substrate. In another example, the vacuum applied to the substrate may vary across the forming surface so as to vary the basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material across the substrate. 
     In another embodiment, the step of depositing may further comprise pneumatically delivering the absorbent particulate polymer material to the substrate and varying the pneumatic delivery to the forming surface so as to vary the amount of absorbent particulate polymer material across the substrate. In one embodiment, the method may further include adhering the first substrate to a second substrate about their peripheries to form an envelope about the absorbent particulate polymer material to hold the absorbent particulate polymer material within the absorbent core. 
     In one embodiment, the first substrate and the second substrate may be adhered to one another about an area defining the bottom of the at least one cavity. In one embodiment, the at least one cavity may be stamped into the absorbent core. 
     In still another aspect, a method is provided for making a disposable absorbent article. The method may comprise depositing an absorbent particulate polymer material on a substrate to form an absorbent core which is substantially cellulose free; forming at least one cavity in the absorbent core, said at least one cavity being defined at least about its perimeter by the absorbent particulate polymer material; and locating the absorbent core between a top sheet and a back sheet of a chassis. In one embodiment, the method may further include adhering a core cover and a dusting layer to one another about a periphery of the absorbent core to form an envelope about the absorbent particulate polymer materials to hold the absorbent particulate polymer material within the absorbent core. In one case, the method may further include adhering the core cover and the dusting layer to one another at an area about the bottom of the at least one cavity. In one embodiment, the method may further include locating an acquisition system between the top sheet and the absorbent core. 
     Features and advantages of the invention may be apparent from the following detailed description, drawings, and claims.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
     A disposable absorbent article has been developed which comprises a chassis, which may include a top sheet and a back sheet, and an absorbent core which may be located between the top sheet and the back sheet and may comprise an absorbent particulate polymer material. The absorbent core may include one or more cavities, for accommodating a bowel movement, defined at least about its perimeter by the absorbent particulate polymer material redistributed (versus cavity-less core) whilst maintaining overall liquid containment capacity. In a certain embodiment, the disposable absorbent article may have a central longitudinal axis extending from a first end to a second end, and the cavity may include (i) a first channel elongated in a direction substantially parallel to and located about the central longitudinal axis, and (ii) a second channel elongated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis. The disposable absorbent article optionally may further include an elasticized top sheet located adjacent the top sheet and having at least one opening, a portion of which may be substantially aligned with the first channel of the cavity in the absorbent core. Embodiments of such disposable absorbent articles are described hereinbelow along with embodiments of apparatuses and methods for making such disposable absorbent articles. 
     Definitions 
     “Absorbent article” refers to devices that absorb and contain body exudates, and, more specifically, refers to devices that are placed against or in proximity to the body of the wearer to absorb and contain the various exudates discharged from the body. Absorbent articles may include diapers, training pants, adult incontinence undergarments, feminine hygiene products, breast pads, care mats, bibs, wound dressing products, and the like. As used herein, the term “body fluids” or “body exudates” includes, but is not limited to, urine, blood, vaginal discharges, breast milk, sweat and fecal matter. 
     “Absorbent core” means a structure typically disposed between a top sheet and cover sheet of an absorbent article for absorbing and containing liquid received by the absorbent article and may comprise one or more substrates, absorbent polymer material disposed on the one or more substrates, and a thermoplastic composition on the absorbent particulate polymer material and at least a portion of the one or more substrates for immobilizing the absorbent particulate polymer material on the one or more substrates. In a multilayer absorbent core, the absorbent core may also include a cover layer. The one or more substrates and the cover layer may comprise a nonwoven. Further, the absorbent core may be substantially cellulose free. The absorbent core does not include an acquisition system, a top sheet, or a back sheet of the absorbent article. In a certain embodiment, the absorbent core would consist essentially of the one or more substrates, the absorbent polymer material, the thermoplastic composition, and optionally the cover layer. In another embodiment, the amount of absorbent particulate polymer material present in the absorbent core may vary across the absorbent core. 
     “Absorbent polymer material,” “absorbent gelling material,” “AGM,” “super absorbent,” and “super absorbent material” are used herein interchangeably and refer to cross linked polymeric materials that can absorb at least 5 times their weight of an aqueous fluid such as 0.9% saline as measured using the Centrifuge Retention Capacity test. 
     “Absorbent particulate polymer material” is used herein to refer to an absorbent polymer material which is in particulate form so as to be flowable in the dry state. 
     “Airfelt” is used herein to refer to comminuted wood pulp, which is a form of cellulosic fiber. 
     “Basis weight” means weight of a material per unit area of the material. 
     “Comprise,” “comprising,” and “comprises” are open ended terms, each specifies the presence of what follows, e.g., a component, but does not preclude the presence of other features, e.g., elements, steps, components known in the art, or disclosed herein. 
     “Consisting essentially of” is used herein to limit the scope of subject matter, such as that in a claim, to the specified materials or steps and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the subject matter. 
     “Disposable” is used in its ordinary sense to mean an article that is disposed or discarded after a limited number of usage events over varying lengths of time, such as less than about 20 events, or less than about 10 events, or less than about 5 events, or less than about 2 events. 
     “Diaper” refers to an absorbent article generally worn by infants and incontinent persons about the lower torso so as to encircle the waist and legs of the wearer and that is specifically adapted to receive and contain urinary and fecal waste. As used herein, term “diaper” also includes “pants” which is defined below. 
     “Fiber” and “filament” are used interchangeably. 
     “Hydrophilic” describes fibers or surfaces of fibers, which are wettable by aqueous fluids (e.g. aqueous body fluids) deposited on these fibers. Hydrophilicity and wettability are typically defined in terms of contact angle and the strike through time of the fluids, for example through a nonwoven fabric. This is discussed in detail in the American Chemical Society publication entitled “Contact angle, wettability and adhesion”, edited by Robert F. Gould (Copyright 1964). A fiber or surface of a fiber is said to be wetted by a fluid (i.e. hydrophilic) when either the contact angle between the fluid and the fiber, or its surface, is less than 90°, or when the fluid tends to spread spontaneously across the surface of the fiber, both conditions are normally co-existing. Conversely, a fiber or surface of the fiber is considered to be hydrophobic if the contact angle is greater than 90° and the fluid does not spread spontaneously across the surface of the fiber. 
     A “nonwoven” is a manufactured sheet, web or batt of directionally or randomly orientated fibers, bonded by friction, and/or cohesion and/or adhesion, excluding paper and products which are woven, knitted, tufted, stitch-bonded incorporating binding yarns or filaments, or felted by wet-milling, whether or not additionally needled. The fibers may be of natural or man-made origin and may be staple or continuous filaments or be formed in situ. Commercially available fibers have diameters ranging from less than about 0.001 mm to more than about 0.2 mm and they come in several different forms: short fibers (known as staple, or chopped), continuous single fibers (filaments or monofilaments), untwisted bundles of continuous filaments (tow), and twisted bundles of continuous filaments (yarn). Nonwoven fabrics can be formed by many processes such as meltblowing, spunbonding, solvent spinning, electrospinning, and carding. The basis weight of nonwoven fabrics is usually expressed in grams per square meter (gsm). 
     “Pant” or “training pant”, as used herein, refer to disposable garments having a waist opening and leg openings designed for infant or adult wearers. A pant may be placed in position on the wearer by inserting the wearer&#39;s legs into the leg openings and sliding the pant into position about a wearer&#39;s lower torso. A pant may be preformed by any suitable technique including, but not limited to, joining together portions of the article using refastenable and/or non-refastenable bonds (e.g., seam, weld, adhesive, cohesive bond, fastener, etc.). A pant may be preformed anywhere along the circumference of the article (e.g., side fastened, front waist fastened). While the terms “pant” or “pants” are used herein, pants are also commonly referred to as “closed diapers,” “prefastened diapers,” “pull-on diapers,” “training pants,” and “diaper-pants”. Suitable pants are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,433, issued to Hasse, et al. on Sep. 21, 1993; U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,234, issued to Buell et al. on Oct. 29, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,487, issued to Ashton on Sep. 19, 2000; U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,489, issued to Johnson et al. on Sep. 19, 2000; U.S. Pat. No. 4,940,464, issued to Van Gompel et al. on Jul. 10, 1990; U.S. Pat. No. 5,092,861, issued to Nomura et al. on Mar. 3, 1992; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0233082 A1, entitled “Highly Flexible And Low Deformation Fastening Device”, filed on Jun. 13, 2002; U.S. Pat. No. 5,897,545, issued to Kline et al. on Apr. 27, 1999; U.S. Pat. No. 5,957,908, issued to Kline et al on Sep. 28, 1999. 
     “Substantially cellulose free” is used herein to describe an article, such as an absorbent core, that contains less than about 10% by weight cellulosic fibers, less than about 5% cellulosic fibers, less than about 1% cellulosic fibers, no cellulosic fibers, or no more than an immaterial amount of cellulosic fibers. An immaterial amount of cellulosic material would not materially affect the thinness, flexibility, or absorbency of an absorbent core. 
     “Substantially continuously distributed”, as used herein, refers to absorbent particulate polymer material that is arranged across the absorbent particulate polymer material area. Optionally, the absorbent particulate polymer material may be arranged such that the substrate layers do not touch in zones  122  and  124 . In one embodiment, the substrate layers may touch in the peripheral areas outside the absorbent particulate polymer material area. It is important to note that the thermoplastic material used in the presently described disposable absorbent articles does not interrupt the substantially continuously distributed absorbent particulate polymer material. Thus, the substantially continuously distributed absorbent particulate polymer material includes the thermoplastic material. 
     “Substantially free of absorbent particulate polymer material”, as used herein, refers to the one or more cavities of the absorbent core having an area (in plan view) in which the absorbent particulate polymer material is present in an amount not exceeding 10% of the basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material in the area of the absorbent core surrounding the one or more cavities. 
     “Thickness” and “caliper” are used herein interchangeably.

The waist regions  30  and  32  may include elastic elements such that they gather about the waist of the wearer to provide improved fit and containment (elastic waist feature  26 ). The crotch region  34  is that portion of the diaper  10  which, when the diaper  10  is worn, is generally positioned between the wearer&#39;s legs. 
     The diaper  10  is depicted in  FIG. 1  with its central longitudinal axis  36  and its transverse axis  38 . The periphery  40  of the diaper  10  is defined by the outer edges of the diaper  10  in which the longitudinal edges  42  run generally parallel to the longitudinal axis  36  of the diaper  10  and the end edges  44  run between the longitudinal edges  42  generally parallel to the transverse axis  38  of the diaper  10 . The chassis  12  may also comprise a fastening system, which may include at least one fastening member  46  and at least one stored landing zone  48 . 
     The diaper  10  may also include such other features as are known in the art including front and rear ear panels, waist cap features, elastics and the like to provide better fit, containment and aesthetic characteristics. Such additional features are well known in the art and are e.g., described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,860,003 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,092. 
     In order to keep the diaper  10  in place about the wearer, at least a portion of the first waist region  30  may be attached by the fastening member  46  to at least a portion of the second waist region  32  to form leg opening(s) and an article waist. When fastened, the fastening system carries a tensile load around the article waist. The fastening system may allow an article user to hold one element of the fastening system, such as the fastening member  46 , and connect the first waist region  30  to the second waist region  32  in at least two places. This may be achieved through manipulation of bond strengths between the fastening device elements. 
     According to certain embodiments, the diaper  10  may be provided with a re-closable fastening system or may alternatively provided in the form of a pant-type diaper. When the absorbent article is a diaper, it may comprise a re-closable fastening system joined to the chassis for securing the diaper to a wearer. When the absorbent article is a pant-type diaper, the article may comprise at least two side panels joined to the chassis and to each other to form a pant. The fastening system and any component thereof may include any material suitable for such a use, including but not limited to plastics, films, foams, nonwoven webs, woven webs, paper, laminates, fiber reinforced plastics and the like, or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the materials making up the fastening device may be flexible. The flexibility may allow the fastening system to conform to the shape of the body and thus, reduce the likelihood that the fastening system will irritate or injure the wearer&#39;s skin. 
     For unitary absorbent articles, the chassis  12  and absorbent core  14  may form the main structure of the diaper  10  with other features added to form the composite diaper structure. While the top sheet  18 , the back sheet  20 , and the absorbent core  14  may be assembled in a variety of well-known configurations, certain diaper configurations are described generally in U.S. Pat. No. 5,554,145 to Roe et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,234 to Buell et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,306 to Robles et al. on Dec. 21, 1999. 
     The top sheet  18  in  FIG. 1  may be fully or partially elasticized or may be foreshortened to provide a void space between the top sheet  18  and the absorbent core  14 . Exemplary structures including elasticized or foreshortened top sheets are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,416 to Allen et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,269,775 to Freeland et al. 
     The back sheet  20  may be joined with the top sheet  18 . The back sheet  20  may prevent the exudates absorbed by the absorbent core  14  and contained within the diaper  10  from soiling other external articles that may contact the diaper  10 , such as bed sheets and undergarments. In certain embodiments, the back sheet  20  may be substantially impervious to liquids (e.g., urine) and comprise a laminate of a nonwoven and a thin plastic film such as a thermoplastic film having a thickness of about 0.012 mm (0.5 mil) to about 0.051 mm (2.0 mils). Suitable back sheet films include those manufactured by Tredegar Industries Inc. (Terre Haute, Ind.) and sold under the trade names X15306, X10962, and X10964. Other suitable back sheet materials may include breathable materials that permit vapors to escape from the diaper  10  while still preventing exudates from passing through the back sheet  10 . Exemplary breathable materials may include materials such as woven webs, nonwoven webs, composite materials such as film-coated nonwoven webs, and microporous films such as manufactured by Mitsui Toatsu Co. (Japan) under the designation ESPOIR NO and by EXXON Chemical Co. (Bay City, Tex.) under the designation EXXAIRE. Suitable breathable composite materials comprising polymer blends are available from Clopay Corporation (Cincinnati, Ohio) under the name HYTREL blend P18-3097. Such breathable composite materials are described in PCT Application No. WO 95/16746, published Jun. 22, 1995 in the name of E.I. DuPont. Other breathable back sheets including nonwoven webs and apertured formed films are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,096 to Dobrin et al. 
       FIG. 2  shows a cross section of  FIG. 1  taken along the sectional line  2 - 2  of  FIG. 1 . Starting from the wearer facing side, the diaper  10  may comprise the top sheet  18 , the components of the absorbent core  14 , and the back sheet  20 . According to a certain embodiment, diaper  10  may also comprise an acquisition system  50  disposed between the liquid permeable top sheet  18  and a wearer facing side of the absorbent core  14 . The acquisition system  50  may be in direct contact with the absorbent core. The acquisition system  50  may comprise a single layer or multiple layers, such as an upper acquisition layer  52  facing the towards the wearer&#39;s skin and a lower acquisition  54  layer facing the garment of the wearer. According to a certain embodiment, the acquisition system  50  may function to receive a surge of liquid, such as a gush of urine, and quickly absorb the liquid and distribute it across the absorbent core  14  so that the absorbent core absorbs the liquid before the liquid flows beyond the absorbent layer  14  and out of the diaper  10 . In other words, the acquisition system  50  may serve as a temporary reservoir for liquid until the absorbent core  14  can absorb the liquid. 
     In a certain embodiment, the acquisition system  50  may comprise chemically cross-linked cellulosic fibers. Such cross-linked cellulosic fibers may have desirable absorbency properties. Exemplary chemically cross-linked cellulosic fibers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,537 which is incorporated herein by reference. In certain embodiments, the chemically cross-linked cellulosic fibers have between about 0.5 mole % and about 10.0 mole % of a C 2  to C 9  polycarboxylic cross-linking agent or between about 1.5 mole % and about 6.0 mole % of a C 2  to C 9  polycarboxylic cross-linking agent. Citric acid is an exemplary cross-linking agent. In other embodiments, polyacrylic acids may be used. Further, according to certain embodiments, the cross-linked cellulosic fibers have a water retention value of about 25 to about 60, or about 28 to about 50, or about 30 to about 45. A method for determining water retention value is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,537. According to certain embodiments, the cross-linked cellulosic fibers may be crimped, twisted, or curled, or a combination thereof including crimped, twisted, and curled. 
     In a certain embodiment, one or both of the upper and lower acquisition layers  52  and  54  may comprise a non-woven, which may be hydrophilic. Further, according to a certain embodiment, one or both of the upper and lower acquisition layers  52  and  54  may comprise the chemically cross-linked cellulosic fibers, which may or may not form part of a nonwoven material. According to an exemplary embodiment, the upper acquisition layer  52  may comprise a nonwoven, without the cross-linked cellulosic fibers, and the lower acquisition layer  54  may comprise the chemically cross-linked cellulosic fibers. Further, according to an embodiment, the lower acquisition layer  54  may comprise the chemically cross-linked cellulosic fibers mixed with other fibers such as natural or synthetic polymeric fibers. According to exemplary embodiments, such other natural or synthetic polymeric fibers may include high surface area fibers, thermoplastic binding fibers, polyethylene fibers, polypropylene fibers, PET fibers, rayon fibers, lyocell fibers, and mixtures thereof. According to a one embodiment, the lower acquisition layer  54  has a total dry weight, the cross-linked cellulosic fibers are present on a dry weight basis in the first acquisition layer in an amount from about 30% to about 95% by weight of the lower acquisition layer  54 , and the other natural or synthetic polymeric fibers are present on a dry weight basis in the lower acquisition layer  54  in an amount from about 70% to about 5% by weight of the lower acquisition layer  54 . According to another embodiment, the cross-linked cellulosic fibers are present on a dry weight basis in the first acquisition layer in an amount from about 80% to about 90% by weight of the lower acquisition layer  54 , and the other natural or synthetic polymeric fibers are present on a dry weight basis in the lower acquisition layer  54  in an amount from about 20% to about 10% by weight of the lower acquisition layer  54 . 
     According to a certain embodiment, the lower acquisition layer  54  desirably has a high fluid uptake capability. Fluid uptake is measured in grams of absorbed fluid per gram of absorbent material and is expressed by the value of “maximum uptake.” A high fluid uptake corresponds therefore to a high capacity of the material and is beneficial, because it ensures the complete acquisition of fluids to be absorbed by an acquisition material. According to exemplary embodiments, the lower acquisition layer  54  has a maximum uptake of about 10 g/g. 
     A relevant attribute of the lower acquisition layer  54  is its Medium Desorption Pressure (MDP) which is related to acquisition speed. The MDP is a measure of the capillary pressure that is required to dewater the lower acquisition layer  54  to about 50% of its capacity at 0 cm capillary suction height as derived from the Capillary Sorption test. Generally, a relatively lower MDP may be useful. The lower MDP may allow the lower acquisition layer  54  to more efficiently drain the acquisition material and utilize more of its capillary suction to distribute liquid to the absorbent core  14 . Without wishing to be bound by theory, a given distribution material may have a definable capillary suction. The ability of the lower acquisition layer  54  to move liquid vertically via capillary forces will be directly impacted by the opposing capillary forces associated desorption. Minimizing these capillary forces may positively impact the performance of the lower acquisition layer  54 . However, in a certain embodiment the lower acquisition layer  54  may also have adequate capillary absorption suction in order to drain the layers above (upper acquisition layer  52  and top sheet  18 , in particular) and to temporarily hold liquid until the liquid can be partitioned away by the absorbent core components. Therefore, in a certain embodiment, the lower acquisition layer  54  may have a minimum MDP which should correspond to a height of greater than 5 cm. Further, according to exemplary embodiments, the lower acquisition layer  54  has an MDP value of less than about 20.5 cm H 2 O, or less than about 19 cm H 2 O, or less than about 18 cm H 2 O to provide for fast acquisition. 
     The methods for determining MDP and maximum uptake are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0118087 A1 (Flohr et al.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. 
     For example, according to one embodiment, the lower acquisition layer  54  may comprise 7 about 0% by weight of chemically cross-linked cellulose fibers, about 10% by weight polyester (PET), and about 20% by weight untreated pulp fibers. According to a second embodiment, the lower acquisition layer  54  may comprise about 70% by weight chemically cross-linked cellulose fibers, about 20% by weight lyocell fibers, and about 10% by weight PET fibers. According to a third embodiment, the lower acquisition layer  54  may comprise about 68% by weight chemically cross-linked cellulose fibers, about 16% by weight untreated pulp fibers, and about 16% by weight PET fibers. 
     Suitable non-woven materials for the upper and lower acquisition layers  52  and  54  include, but are not limited to SMS material, comprising a spunbonded, a melt-blown and a further spunbonded layer. In certain embodiments, permanently hydrophilic non-wovens, and in particular, nonwovens with durably hydrophilic coatings are desirable. Another suitable embodiment comprises a SMMS-structure. In certain embodiments, the non-wovens are porous. 
     In certain embodiments, suitable non-woven materials may include, but are not limited to, synthetic fibers, such as PE, PET, and PP. As polymers used for nonwoven production may be inherently hydrophobic, they may be coated with hydrophilic coatings. One way to produce nonwovens with durably hydrophilic coatings, is via applying a hydrophilic monomer and a radical polymerization initiator onto the nonwoven, and conducting a polymerization activated via UV light resulting in monomer chemically bound to the surface of the nonwoven as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0097895 A1 (Busam et al.). Another way to produce nonwovens with durably hydrophilic coatings is to coat the nonwoven with hydrophilic nanoparticles as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,621 to Rohrbaugh et al. and PCT Application Publication WO 02/064877. 
     Typically, nanoparticles have a largest dimension of below 750 nm. Nanoparticles with sizes ranging form 2 to 750 nm may be economically produced. An advantage of nanoparticles is that many of them can be easily dispersed in water solution to enable coating application onto the nonwoven, they typically form transparent coatings, and the coatings applied from water solutions are typically sufficiently durable to exposure to water. Nanoparticles can be organic or inorganic, synthetic or natural. Inorganic nanoparticles generally exist as oxides, silicates, carbonates. Typical examples of suitable nanoparticles are layered clay minerals (e.g., LAPONITE™ from Southern Clay Products, Inc. (USA), and Boehmite alumina (e.g., Disperal P2™ from North American Sasol. Inc.). According to a certain embodiment, a suitable nanoparticle coated non-woven is that disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0158212 (Ponomarenko et al.). 
     Further useful non-wovens are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,645,569 to Cramer et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,863,933 to Cramer et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,621 to Rohrbaugh et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0148684 (Cramer et al.), and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0008839 (Cramer et al.) 
     In some cases, the nonwoven surface can be pre-treated with high energy treatment (corona, plasma) prior to application of nanoparticle coatings. High energy pre-treatment typically temporarily increases the surface energy of a low surface energy surface (such as PP) and thus enables better wetting of a nonwoven by the nanoparticle dispersion in water. 
     Notably, permanently hydrophilic non-wovens are also useful in other parts of an absorbent article. For example, top sheets and absorbent core layers comprising permanently hydrophilic non-wovens as described above have been found to work well. 
     According to a certain embodiment, the upper acquisition layer  52  may comprise a material that provides good recovery when external pressure is applied and removed. Further, according to a certain embodiment, the upper acquisition layer  52  may comprise a blend of different fibers selected, for example from the types of polymeric fibers described above. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the fibers may exhibit a spiral-crimp which has a helical shape. In some embodiments, the upper acquisition layer  52  may comprise fibers having different degrees or types of crimping, or both. For example, one embodiment may include a mixture of fibers having about 8 to about 12 crimps per inch (cpi) or about 9 to about 10 cpi, and other fibers having about 4 to about 8 cpi or about 5 to about 7 cpi. Different types of crimps include, but are not limited to, a 2D crimp or “flat crimp” and a 3D or spiral-crimp. According to a certain embodiment, the fibers may include bi-component fibers, which are individual fibers each comprising different materials, usually a first and a second polymeric material. It is believed that the use of side-by-side bi-component fibers is beneficial for imparting a spiral-crimp to the fibers. 
     The upper acquisition layer  52  may be stabilized by a latex binder, for example a styrene-butadiene latex binder (SB latex), in a certain embodiment. Processes for obtaining such lattices are known, for example, from EP 149 880 (Kwok) and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0105190 (Diehl et al.). According to a certain embodiment, SB lattices may be obtained using more than about 10 weight % of a mono-, or bi-carboxylic acid, and will herein be referred to as having a carboxylation level of more than about 10%. Further, according to a certain embodiment, SB lattices may have a carboxylation level from about 10% to about 25%, for example about 10% to about 20%. In certain embodiments, the binder may be present in the upper acquisition layer  52  in excess of about 12%, about 14% or about 16% by weight. For certain embodiments, SB latex is available under the trade name GENFLO™ 3160 (OMNOVA Solutions Inc.; Akron, Ohio). 
     The absorbent core  14  in  FIGS. 1-10  generally is disposed between the top sheet  18  and the back sheet  20  and comprises two layers, a first absorbent layer  60  and a second absorbent layer  62 . As best shown in  FIG. 3 , the first absorbent layer  60  of the absorbent core  14  comprises a substrate  64 , an absorbent particulate polymer material  66  on the substrate  64 , and a thermoplastic composition  68  on the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and at least portions of the first substrate  64  as an adhesive for covering and immobilizing the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  on the first substrate  64 . According to another embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 4 , the first absorbent layer  60  of the absorbent core  14  may also include a cover layer  70  on the thermoplastic composition  68 . The absorbent core  14  may also include another layer  69  of thermoplastic composition on the first substrate  64  for anchoring the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  to the first substrate  64 . 
     Likewise, as best illustrated in  FIG. 2 , the second absorbent layer  62  of the absorbent core  14  may also include a substrate  72 , a thermoplastic composition  73  on the substrate, an absorbent particulate polymer material  74  adhered to the second substrate  72  with the thermoplastic composition, and a thermoplastic composition  68  on the absorbent particulate polymer material  74  and at least a portion of the second substrate  72  or first layer of thermoplastic composition for immobilizing the absorbent particulate polymer material  74  on the second substrate  72 . Although not illustrated, the second absorbent layer  62  may also include a cover layer such as the cover layer  70  illustrated in  FIG. 4 . 
     The substrate  64  of the first absorbent layer  60  may be referred to as a dusting layer and has a first surface  78  which faces the back sheet  20  of the diaper  10  and a second surface  80  which faces the absorbent particulate polymer material  66 . Likewise, the substrate  72  of the second absorbent layer  62  may be referred to as a core cover and has a first surface  82  facing the top sheet  18  of the diaper  10  and a second surface  84  facing the absorbent particulate polymer material  74 . The first and second substrates  64  and  72  may be adhered to one another with adhesive about the periphery to form an envelope about the absorbent particulate polymer materials  66  and  74  to hold the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  within the absorbent core  14 . 
     According to a certain embodiment, the substrates  64  and  72  of the first and second absorbent layers  60  and  62  may be a non-woven material, such as those nonwoven materials described above. In certain embodiments, the non-wovens are porous and in one embodiment has a pore size of about 32 microns. 
     As illustrated in  FIGS. 1-8 , the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  may be deposited on the respective substrates  64  and  72  of the first and second absorbent layers  60  and  62  in small and large clusters  90  and  91  of particles to form a grid pattern  92  comprising land areas  94  and junction areas  96  between the land areas  94 . The junction areas  96  in the grid pattern  92  contain little or no absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 . The land areas  94  and junction areas  96  can have a variety of shapes including, but not limited to, circular, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, and the like. 
     The small clusters  90  of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  are thinner than the large clusters  91  of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  and impart a lower basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  to the area of the absorbent core  14  in which the small clusters  90  are located. Likewise, the large clusters  91  of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  are thicker than the small clusters  90  of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  and impart a higher basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  to the area of the absorbent core  14  in which the large clusters  91  are located. This creates a varied profile of absorbent particulate polymer material across the absorbent core  14 . At least one cavity can be created in the absorbent core by a combination of machine direction profiling and cross-machine direction profiling, so as to create at least one region having relatively little or no absorbent particulate polymer material (e.g., a low basis weight region) bounded by a region of relatively more absorbent particulate polymer material (i.e., a high basis weight region). 
     As shown in  FIG. 8 , the absorbent core  14  has a longitudinal axis  100  extending from a rear end  102  to a front end  104  and a transverse axis  106  perpendicular to the longitudinal axis  100  extending from a first edge  108  to a second edge  110 . The grid pattern  92  of absorbent particulate polymer material clusters  90  and  91  is arranged on the substrates  64  and  72  of the respective absorbent layers  60  and  62  such that the grid pattern  92  formed by the arrangement of land areas  94  and junction areas  96  forms a pattern angle  112 . While the pattern angle  112  may be such that the grid pattern  92  is parallel with the first and second edges  108  and  110  of the absorbent core  14 , the pattern angle  112  may be greater than 0, or 15 to 30 degrees, or from about 5 to about 85 degrees, or from about 10 to about 60 degrees, or from about 15 to about 30 degrees from the longitudinal axis  100  of the absorbent core  14 . 
     As best seen in  FIGS. 7 and 8 , the first and second layers  60  and  62  may be combined to form the absorbent core  14 . The absorbent core  14  has an absorbent particulate polymer material area  114  bounded by a pattern length  116  and a pattern width  118 . The extent and shape of the absorbent particulate polymer material area  114  may vary depending on the desired application of the absorbent core  14  and the particular absorbent article in which it may be incorporated. In a certain embodiment, however, the absorbent particulate polymer material area  114  may extend substantially entirely across the absorbent core  14 , such as is illustrated in  FIG. 8 . 
     The size of the land areas  94  in the grid patterns  92  may vary. According to certain embodiments, the width of the land areas  94  in the grid patterns  92  ranges from about 8 mm to about 12 mm. In a certain embodiment, the width of the land areas  94  is about 10 mm. The junction areas  96 , on the other hand, in certain embodiments, have a width or larger span of less than about 5 mm, less than about 3 mm, less than about 2 mm, less than about 1.5 mm, less than about 1 mm, or less than about 0.5 mm. 
     The first and second absorbent layers  60  and  62  may be combined together to form the absorbent core  14  such that the grid patterns  92  of the respective first and second absorbent layers  62  and  64  are offset from one another along the length and/or width of the absorbent core  14 . The respective grid patterns  92  may be offset such that the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  is substantially continuously distributed across the absorbent particulate polymer area  114 . In a certain embodiment, absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  is substantially continuously distributed across the absorbent particulate polymer material area  114  despite the individual grid patterns  92  comprising absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  discontinuously distributed across the first and second substrates  64  and  72  in clusters  90  and  91 . In a certain embodiment, the grid patterns may be offset such that the land areas  94  of the first absorbent layer  60  face the junction areas  96  of the second absorbent layer  62  and the land areas of the second absorbent layer  62  face the junction areas  96  of the first absorbent layer  60 . When the land areas  94  and junction areas  96  are appropriately sized and arranged, the resulting combination of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  is a substantially continuous layer of absorbent particular polymer material across the absorbent particulate polymer material area  114  of the absorbent core  14 . In a certain embodiment, respective grid patterns  92  of the first and second absorbent layer  60  and  62  may be substantially the same. 
     In a certain embodiment as illustrated in  FIGS. 1-8 , the amount of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  may vary along the width  118  of the grid pattern  92  substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis  36  of disposable absorbent diaper  10 . In a certain embodiment, the grid pattern may be divided into absorbent zones  120 ,  121  and  122 , or another number of zones, in which the amount of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  per unit area of the absorbent core  14  varies from zone to zone. The amount of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  may, in a certain embodiment, gradually transition from one of the plurality of absorbent zones  120 ,  121 , and  122  to another. This gradual transition in amount of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  may reduce the possibility of cracks forming in the absorbent core  14 . 
     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIGS. 1-8  the first and second side absorbent zones  120  and  122  are spaced from one another and extend substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis  36  of the diaper  10  and the central absorbent zone  121  extends substantially along the longitudinal axis and between the first and second side absorbent zones  120  and  122 . The absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  present in the first and second side absorbent zones  120  and  122  of the absorbent core  14  has a basis weight greater than the basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  present in the central absorbent zone  121  of the absorbent core  14 . 
     In alternative embodiments, the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  in the central absorbent zone  121  of the absorbent core  14  has a higher basis weight than in the first and second side absorbent zones  120  and  122  of the absorbent core  14 . When the absorbent core  14  according to this embodiment is subjected to a flush of liquid directed at the central absorbent zone  121 , liquid that flows over and past the central absorbent zone  121  contacts the side absorbent zones  120  and  122 . The first and second side absorbent zones  120  and  122  have more absorbent particulate polymer material and have greater capacity to absorb such liquid and deter flow of the liquid beyond the side absorbent zones  120  and  122  to prevent leakage. 
     Although the embodiment illustrated in  FIGS. 1-8  has only three absorbent zones  120 ,  121 , and  122 , the absorbent diaper  10  may include any number of absorbent zones having varying basis weights of absorbent particulate polymer. Furthermore, in other embodiments, the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  may be varied in different patterns such as by placing more absorbent particulate polymer material in the central absorbent zone  121  than in the side absorbent zone  120  and  122  or alternating areas of greater and lesser amounts of absorbent particulate polymer material per unit area of the absorbent core. 
     Another embodiment of an absorbent core  14 ′ is illustrated in  FIG. 9  and the basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  varies across the absorbent core  14 ′ in a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis  36 . This absorbent core  14 ′ comprises first and second end absorbent zones  123  and  124 , spaced form one another and extending substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the absorbent core, and a central absorbent zone  125 , extending substantially along the longitudinal axis  36  and between the first and second end absorbent zones  123  and  124 . The basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material in the absorbent end zones  123  and  124  of the absorbent core  14 ′ is greater than in the central absorbent zone  125  of the absorbent core  14 ′. When the absorbent core  14 ′ illustrated in  FIG. 9  is subjected to a flush of liquid directed at the central absorbent zone  125 , liquid that flows past the central absorbent zone  125  encounters end absorbent zones  123  and  124  which have greater capacity to absorb and hold such liquid. 
     Although the absorbent core  14 ′ illustrated in  FIG. 9  has only three absorbent zones  123 ,  124 , and  125 , the absorbent core  14 ′ may include any number of absorbent zones arranged in a variety of different patterns of varying absorbent particulate polymer material basis weights. In other embodiments, the basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  in the central absorbent zone  125  may be greater than in the end absorbent zones  123  and  124  or the absorbent core  14 ′ may include a multitude of alternating absorbent zones of varying absorbent particulate polymer material basis weights. 
     Another embodiment of an absorbent core  14 ″ is illustrated in  FIG. 10  and comprises first and second side absorbent zones  120 ′ and  122 ′ spaced from one another and extending substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis  36 , first and second end absorption zones  123 ′ and  124 ′ spaced from one another and extending substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis  36 , and a central portion  121 ′ and  125 ′ extending substantially along the longitudinal axis  36  and between the first and second side absorbent zones  120 ′ and  122 ′ and between the first and second end absorbent zones  123 ′ and  124 ′. The basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  in the first and second side portions  120 ′ and  122 ′ of the absorbent core  14 ″ is greater than the basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  in the central portion  121 ′ and  125 ′ of the absorbent core  14 ″ and the basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  in the first and second end portions  123 ′ and  124 ′ of the absorbent core  14 ″ is greater than the basis weight of the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  in the central portion  121 ′ and  125 ′ of the absorbent core  14 ″. When the absorbent core  14 ″ illustrated in  FIG. 10  is subjected to a rush of liquid directed at the central absorbent zone  121 ′ and  125 ′, liquid that flows past the central absorbent zone  121 ′ and  125 ′ encounters and may be absorbed by the side absorbent zones  120 ′ and  122 ′ and the end absorbent zones  123 ′ and  124 ′ which all have greater absorbent particulate polymer material basis weights. As with the other embodiments described hereinabove, it should be understood that the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  may be arranged in a variety of different patterns of varying absorbent particulate polymer material basis weights. In one such embodiment, the central absorbent zone  121 ′ and  125 ′ may have a higher absorbent particulate polymer material basis weight than the side absorbent zones  120 ′ and  122 ′ and the end absorbent zones  123 ′ and  124 ′. 
     A certain embodiment of an absorbent core  214  is illustrated in  FIGS. 11-12 . Absorbent core  214  may be constructed like absorbent cores  14 ,  14 ′, or  14 ″ described herein. The absorbent core  214  comprises at least one cavity  215 , which is sized and positioned to receive fecal matter, for example to contain and direct the fecal matter away from the skin of a person wearing a disposable absorbent article which comprises the absorbent core  214 . In certain embodiments, the void volume of the cavity (or total volume of multiple cavities) may be from 2 ml to about 20 ml when the absorbent core  214  is in a dry state. When the absorbent core  214  becomes wet, expansion of the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  swells, causing the cavity volume to increase. For example, the void volume of the cavity may be from about 25 ml to 35 ml (in use, when fluid is present), e.g., about 30 ml. In one embodiment, the cavity volume may be from about 50 to about 70 ml when the absorbent core is in a saturated state. 
     The cavity may be defined at least about its perimeter by the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  (with associated first and second substrates  64  and  72  and thermoplastic material  68  and  76 ). For example, the cavity may be formed by CD and MD profiling of the core, creating an area with a lower basis weight absorbent particulate polymer material, or no absorbent particulate polymer material, as compared to surrounding areas of the absorbent core. Generally, the greater the basis weight difference between the regions, the greater the depth of the cavity. The volume of the cavity may increase upon swelling of the absorbent particulate polymer material, i.e., after at least one gush of liquid occurs and is taken up by the absorbent particulate polymer material. 
     In a particular embodiment, the region defining the cavity may be substantially free of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 . In one embodiment, the absorbent particulate polymer material that would have been located in the region of the cavity may be redistributed in the absorbent core in the region about the walls or perimeter of the cavity. In this way, the total capacity of the absorbent core is substantially maintained as compared to an absorbent core without such a cavity. One embodiment of such an absorbent core is illustrated in  FIG. 28 , as detailed below. 
     In one embodiment, the first channel of the cavity is located in the absorbent core along the central longitudinal axis of the diaper or pant at a position which is positioned at the so-called “poo point.” That is, when the diaper or pant is worn by a wearer, the cavity will be in alignment with a predetermined region about the anus of the wearer. In one embodiment, the cavity is located about 10 mm from the anus position, which may work to direct the bowel movement into the cavity. 
     In a certain embodiment, the cavity  215  may include a first channel  219  elongated in a direction substantially parallel to and located about the central longitudinal axis  100 , and (ii) a second channel  217  elongated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis  100 . In one embodiment, the first and second channels of the cavity together may form a T-shape, as illustrated in  FIG. 11 . In other embodiments, the first and second channels of the cavity together may form a cross shape, or a Y-shape. The dimensions of the first channel generally should create a stable valley between the buttocks, yet provide a channel for fecal matter; if too wide then the first channel loses stability and if too narrow then it does not adequately accommodate the bowel movement. In various embodiments, the first channel  219  of the cavity  215  may have a width from about 10 mm to about 40 mm and a length from about 10 mm to about 130 mm. In one example, the first channel  219  of the cavity  215  may have a width of about 20 mm and may have a length of about 70 mm. The second channel generally should be dimensioned to provide distribution of the bowel movement in the cross direction once it has been directed to the back of the diaper. In other various embodiments, the second channel  217  of the cavity  215  may have a width from about 10 mm to about 40 mm and a length from about 10 mm to about 100 mm. In another example, the second channel of the cavity may have a width of about 30 mm and a length of about 50 mm. In this T-shaped cavity embodiment, channel length refers to dimensions in the machine direction, and channel width refers to dimensions in the cross-machine direction. 
     The one or more cavities in the absorbent core may have a variety of different geometric shapes. Combinations of different geometric shapes may be used together. The shapes may be connected or may be discrete from one another. The cavities generally are sized and located in the absorbent core in a position to facilitate reception and storage of body exudates, such as fecal matter. The shapes generally may straddle the longitudinal axis.  FIG. 24  illustrates various examples of possible shapes and designs of cavities  215  in the absorbent core  214 , including T-shaped, triangular, diamond, Y-shaped, combination of semi-circle and rectangle, oval, trapezoidal, combination of rectangle and triangle, array of discrete rectangles, array of rectangles connected with perpendicular bar, circular elliptical, V-shaped, X-shaped, triangular, array of circles connected with bar, interrupted triangular, U-shaped, and star-shaped. 
     In addition to the basis weight variation, e.g., the CD and MD profiling, to define the at least one cavity of the absorbent core, the absorbent particulate polymer material present in the remaining part of the absorbent core (other than the at least one cavity) may have a basis weight that varies across other areas of the absorbent core in a direction substantially perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis, in a direction substantially parallel to the central longitudinal axis, or in both directions. Generally, the absorbent particulate polymer material is redistributed away from the cavity area, so that the liquid loading capacity is substantially maintained (versus a conventional flat absorbent core). In one embodiment, illustrated with reference to  FIG. 11 , the absorbent core  214  includes back end and front end absorbent zones  220   a  and  220   b , respectively. The cavity  215  is defined in and bounded by central absorbent zones  226  and  224 , and rear transitional absorbent zone  225  disposed therebetween. The central absorbent zone  226  and front end absorbent zone  220   b  front end have a front transitional zone  222  disposed therebetween. 
     In an embodiment, the basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material in back end and front end absorbent zones  220   a  and  220   b  is from about 200 g/cm 2  to about 300 g/cm 2 , for example between about 220 g/cm 2  and 250 g/cm 2 , such as about 233 g/cm 2 . In an embodiment, the basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material in central absorbent zone  224  is from about 450 g/cm 2  to about 650 g/cm 2 , for example, between about 530 g/cm 2  and 600 g/cm 2 , such as about 568 g/cm 2 . In an embodiment, the basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material in central absorbent zones  226  is from about 200 g/cm 2  to about 400 g/cm 2 , for example, between about 250 g/cm 2  and 350 g/cm 2 , such as about 284 g/cm 2 . In an embodiment, the rear transitional absorbent zone  225  has a basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material between about 300 g/cm 2  and 400 g/cm 2 , such as about 333 g/cm 2 . In an embodiment, the front transitional absorbent zone  222  has a basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material between about 200 g/cm 2  and 300 g/cm 2 , for example between about 240 g/cm 2  and 280 g/cm 2 . Transition zones are optional, and each transition zone may comprise further gradation within the transition zone. 
     The absorbent core  214  may comprise a core cover  72  and a dusting layer  64  adhered to one another about the periphery of the absorbent core  214  to form an envelope about the absorbent particulate polymer materials  66 / 74  to hold the absorbent particulate polymer material within the absorbent core  214 . 
     The cavity may be formed with various constructions. For example,  FIG. 25A  illustrates one embodiment in which some of the absorbent particulate polymer materials  66 / 74  is present in the cavity  215 , but at a lower basis weight relative to the surrounding region of the absorbent core  214 . In another embodiment, as illustrated in  FIG. 25B , substantially none of the absorbent particulate polymer materials  66 / 74  is present in the cavity  215 . 
     In a particular embodiment, the core cover  72  and the dusting layer  64  may be adhered to one another about an area defining the bottom of the at least one cavity  215 , as illustrated in  FIG. 25C . In this embodiment, there is no absorbent particulate polymer material in the bottom of the cavity; however, the sidewalls of the cavity are still defined by the absorbent particulate polymer material. This embodiment may aid cavity shape/volume retention when the absorbent particulate polymer materials swells and takes additional volume, as it would be undesirable for the absorbent particulate polymer materials to swell and thereby reduce the cavity volume available for receiving and holding a bowel movement. In a certain sub-embodiment, most or all of layers of the absorbent article construction about the cavity are connected to the dusting layer, in order to sustain the cavity. These layers can be glued or bonded by application of heat and/or pressure. 
     In one embodiment, the disposable absorbent article  10  may further include an acquisition system  50  located between the absorbent core  214  and the top sheet  18 . In one embodiment, the acquisition system  50  may include an upper acquisition layer  52 , which faces the top sheet  18 , and a lower acquisition layer  54 , which faces the absorbent core  214 . The upper acquisition layer  52  may or may not cover the at least one cavity  215 . The lower acquisition layer  54  may or may not cover the at least one cavity  215 . In another embodiment, the lower acquisition layer may be omitted. Various constructions of absorbent core and acquisition layers are possible; examples are illustrated in  FIGS. 26-28 . 
     In one embodiment, the at least one cavity  215  may further be defined about its perimeter by interior edges of an aperture  216  in the acquisition system  50  and absorbent core  214 , as illustrated in  FIG. 26A . In an alternative embodiment, the absorbent core is substantially planar and the cavity is defined substantially by interior edges of an aperture  216  in the acquisition system  50 , as illustrated in  FIGS. 26B-C . In this embodiment, the void volume achieved is a function of the thickness of the acquisition system. In one embodiment, the aperture  216  in the acquisition system  50 , which defines the shape of the cavity, may be made by a stamping process, adapted from stamping equipment and processes known in the art. The borders of the acquisition layer may be sealed. 
       FIGS. 27A-E  illustrate some of the possible configurations of the acquisition system  50  and absorbent core  214 . In  FIG. 27A , the cavity  215  is not covered at all by the acquisition system  50 , which is offset toward the front end of the absorbent core (e.g., toward the pee point). In  FIG. 27B , the cavity  215  is partially covered by the acquisition system  50 . In  FIG. 27C , the cavity  215  is completely covered by the acquisition system  50 . In  FIG. 27D , a majority of the (smaller) acquisition system  50  is positioned over the cavity  215 . In  FIG. 27E , the acquisition system  50  is shaped to surround part of, but not cover, the cavity  215 . 
     The upper and lower acquisition layers  52  and  54  may, but need not, cover identical areas of the absorbent core  214 . In various embodiments, the upper and lower acquisition layers  52  and  54  may have different sizes and/or positions relative to the absorbent core. In  FIG. 27F , the upper acquisition layer  52  covers part of the cavity  215 , and the lower acquisition layer  54  covers none of the cavity. In  FIG. 27G , the upper acquisition layer  52  covers part of the cavity  215 , and the lower acquisition layer  54  is shaped to surround part of but not cover the cavity  215 . In  FIG. 27H , the upper acquisition layer  52  covers all of the cavity  215 , and the lower acquisition layer  54  is shaped to surround part of but not cover the cavity  215 . In  FIG. 27I , the upper and lower acquisition layers  52  and  54  are approximately coextensive and include an aperture surrounding all of the cavity  215  in the absorbent core  214 . In  FIG. 27J , the upper acquisition layer  52  covers all of the cavity  215 , and the lower acquisition layer  54 , which is smaller than the upper acquisition layer  52  and does not cover the cavity  215 . In  FIG. 27K , the cavity  215  is covered by a single (upper) acquisition layer  52 . In another alternative embodiment, an absorbent core is provided with a cavity that is a through hole extending all the way through the core cover, absorbent particulate polymer materials, and dusting layer. For instance the cavity may be formed by a stamping process, and then the borders/edges of the cavity may be sealed, for example, by use of an adhesive and/or a heating or pressure process. In such an embodiment, the back sheet, and/or another layer, of the absorbent article may serve as the back/bottom of the cavity to contain the bowel movement. 
     The acquisition system may augment the caliper of the cavity of the absorbent article. In one embodiment, shown in  FIGS. 28A-B , the absorbent core  214  includes a cavity  215 , which is partially covered by an acquisition layer  52 . The basis weight (and thickness) of the absorbent particulate polymer material in the absorbent core  214  varies in the regions about the cavity  215 . The basis weight in region  232  is higher than the basis weight in region  234 . Region  233  may provide a smooth gradient of basis weight between regions  232  and  234 . The acquisition layer  52  may supplement the caliper of region  234  to approach, meet, or exceed the caliper of region  232 . 
     In another embodiment, which is illustrated in  FIGS. 13 and 14 , an absorbent core  214  is part of a disposable absorbent article  302  that comprises an elasticized top sheet  311 , which includes an opening  314  and that in use forms a void  355  for fecal matter encapsulation. This opening  314  is an area completely circumscribed by the top sheet  311 , but where the top sheet material is not present, and which is large enough to receive fecal material, for example, being at least 2 cm long or wide, or having a surface area of at least 2 cm 2 . In a certain embodiment, the elasticized top sheet  314  generally is located adjacent the cavity  215 , such that at least a portion of the opening  314  may be substantially aligned with the first channel  219  of the cavity  215  in the absorbent core  214 . 
     The top sheet  311  and the opening  314  each have a front region  321  and a back region  322 . The diaper  302 , illustrated in  FIGS. 13-14 , includes a back waist band with ears with fasteners  318  and a front waist band  359  with receiving areas for the fasteners. In some configurations, the fasteners comprise hooks and/or adhesive and the receiving areas may be formed from loop-containing material. The diaper  302  further may include elasticated bands along the longitudinal side edges of the diaper  302 , so called leg cuffs  320 . Leg cuffs may also be referred to as leg bands, side flaps, barrier cuffs, or elastic cuffs, as described in; U.S. Pat. No. 3,860,003; U.S. Pat. No. 4,808,178 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,803; U.S. Pat. No. 4,695,278 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,795,454. 
     The disposable absorbent article  302  may also include a sub-layer (which may be part of the absorbent core) disposed between the top sheet  311  and the absorbent core  214 , capable of accepting, and/or immobilizing bodily exudates, typically fecal material. For example as shown in  FIG. 14 , the absorbent core  214  may comprise a specific sub-layer  324 , which comprises means to immobilize fecal material, for example, a layer with vertically extending (z-direction) fibers, or an apertured web or film, as described herein. Suitable materials for use as the sub-layer may include large cell open foams, macro-porous compression resistant non woven highlofts, large size particulate forms of open and closed cell foams (macro and/or microporous), highloft non-wovens, polyolefin, polystyrene, polyurethane foams or particles, structures comprising a multiplicity of vertically oriented, which may be looped, strands of fibers, and/or apertured formed films. (As used herein, the term “microporous” refers to materials that are capable of transporting fluids by capillary action, but having a mean pore size of more than 50 microns. The term “macroporous” refers to materials having pores too large to effect capillary transport of fluid, generally having pores greater than about 0.5 mm (mean) in diameter and more specifically, having pores greater than about 1.0 mm (mean) in diameter, but typically less than 10 mm or even less than 6 mm (mean). 
     The top sheet  311  with at least one opening  314  may be made as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0197992 A1 to Martynus et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. The top sheet may further comprise, in one embodiment, a genital coversheet as described in the same published application. 
     The exact shape of the opening  314  may vary, depending on the size of the top sheet  311  and/or the absorbent article  302 . For example, in one embodiment the opening is in the form of a slit opening with substantially parallel longitudinal side edges, which are connected in the front and back by V-shaped or rounded V-shaped, as shown in  FIG. 13 , front and back edges, wherein both the front and back V-shaped edges comprise two angled edges. In some embodiments, the back V-shaped edges may have a larger angle than the front V-shaped edges. The front V-shaped edges may have an angle of 20° to 100° or, alternately, from 45° to 65°, as shown in  FIG. 14 . The slit opening may optionally extend into an additional cut-out area which is, for example, diamond shaped. In an embodiment, best illustrated in  FIG. 14 , the opening  314  comprises a front end portion  336 , which is curved, disposed between longitudinal side edges  316  of the opening. 
     The dimensions the opening  314  may also vary, depending on the size of the top sheet  311  and/or the absorbent article  302 . In some embodiments, the top sheet  311  may have a slit opening having a longitudinal dimension (length) substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the top sheet  311  and of the diaper  302 . In a stretched state, the opening  314  (or openings) of the top sheet may be configured such that from 20% to 40% or from 20% to 30% of the length of the opening (or total length of the openings) extends from the transverse axis of the top sheet toward the front edge of the top sheet, and the remaining percentage extends towards the back edge of the top sheet. In some embodiments, the maximum length of the slit opening may be about 40% to 90%, about 50% to 80%, or about 60% to 70% of the total length L of the absorbent article. In one example, a size 4 diaper may have a maximum top sheet length of between 45 cm and 55 cm or between 48 cm and 52 cm. In some embodiments, the length of the single slit opening, when the diaper is in stretched state, may be from 20 cm to 40 cm; from 25 cm to 35 cm; or from 28 cm to 32 cm. In some embodiments, the average width of the opening, in stretched state, may be from 5% to 30% or 10% to 25% of the average width of the top sheet (including opening width). In one example, a size 4 diaper may have an average width of the opening of from 15 mm to 60 mm or from 20 mm to 40 mm. 
     As shown in  FIG. 13 , the top sheet  311  may include a primary elasticated area  331  adjacent to or in close proximity with each longitudinal side edge  316  of the opening  314  to form a pair of opposing, elasticated areas. In some embodiments, the primary elasticated areas may extend from the side edges  316  of the opening  314  towards or completely to the front and back edge of the top sheet  311 . Thus, the primary elasticated areas may be longer than the opening  314 . The elasticated area may be positioned over the full length of the top sheet, or at least the part of the top sheet which in use is intended to receive body exudates (e.g., the top sheet minus the parts thereof which form (part of) the waist bands). An elasticated area in the top sheet may be formed from a multitude of thin strands of elastic material or, for example, from a single band of elastic material. The absorbent article may also include secondary elasticated areas in each crotch side portion (i.e., the portion of the top sheet between the longitudinal side edge of the top sheet  311  and the longitudinal side edge of the opening  314 ). Each secondary elasticized area may have an overall curvature, curving away from the primary elasticated area of the same crotch side portion. 
     As shown in  FIG. 13 , the primary elasticated areas  331  may be positioned along the longitudinal side edges  316  of the opening  314 . The top sheet  311  may also have secondary elasticated areas  332 , or even tertiary elasticated areas (not shown). The primary elasticated areas  331  have each a central region with a length L 2 , the central regions being substantially parallel to one another, whereby L 2  may be about 30% to 70% of the total length L 1  of the primary elasticated areas  331 . In an embodiment, L 2  is about 40% to 80% of the maximum length of the opening  314 . The primary elasticated areas  331  may have an X-shape, whereby the front end portions  336  bend away from one another and the back end portions  338  bend away from one another. The primary elasticated areas may also be parallel, such as described in EP Application Publication EP-A-1201212. 
     The primary elasticated area may be shaped such that it has a central portion that is substantially parallel to the central portion of the opposing primary elasticated area. In an embodiment, the central portion has a length L 2  which may be 30% to 70% of the total length L 1  of a corresponding elasticated area, and may be about 40% to 80% of the maximum length of the opening. In some embodiments, the total length of the elasticated area may be about 70% to 90%, about 80% to 90%, or about 85% of maximum length of the top sheet  311 . The length of the primary elasticated area may also depend on the size of the top sheet  311  and/or the article  302 . For example, for a size 4 diaper as described above the average length of the elasticated area in stretched state, may be at least 35 cm, or from 35 cm to 45 cm. The width of the elasticated areas on the top sheet may also vary, depending on the exact dimensions of the top sheet  311  and/or the article  302 . For example, for size 4 diapers as described above, a primary elasticated area, in stretched state, may be an elastic band, or a multitude of elastic strands, that has an average width of about 3 mm to 50 mm, about 3 mm to 40 mm, about 3 mm to 20 mm, or about 5 mm to 20 mm. 
     The front end portions of two opposing primary elasticated areas may bend away from one another (in the plane of the top sheet), so that the distance between the end edges of the opposing front end portions of two opposing elastic areas is larger than the distance between the central portions of two opposing elastic areas, and equally, the distance between the end edges of the opposing back end portions of two opposing elastic areas is larger that the distance between the central portions of two opposing elastic areas. For example, as shown in  FIG. 14 , the primary elasticated areas  331  may be in the shape of an X, whereby each front end portion  336  of the elasticated area has an angle α with the longitudinal line  335  parallel to the longitudinal axis of the top sheet  311  and through that part of the elasticated area that is (directly) adjacent a longitudinal side edge  316  of the opening. In one embodiment, this angle α may be about 17° to 30° in stretched state. In one embodiment, each back end portion  338  of the elasticated area also may have an angle which may be about 17° to 30° in stretched state. 
     In some embodiments, the front end portion of a primary elasticated area may have an angle with a longitudinal line through the central portion of the elasticated area and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the top sheet, the angle may be between 10° and 40°, between 17° to 35°, or between 20° and 35°. In other embodiments, the back end portion of each of the primary elasticated areas may have an angle with a longitudinal line through the central portion of the elasticated area and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the top sheet. In some embodiments, the angle may be between 10° and 40°, between 17° to 35°, or between 20° and 35°. When both front end portions and both back end portions have an angle as above, the primary elasticated areas have, as is herein referred to, an X-shape, and a suitable X-shape is exemplified in  FIG. 13 . 
     In some embodiments, the front end and/or the back end and/or the central portion of an elasticated area may be curved rather than straight. In such an embodiment, the angles above may be determined by the angle of the tangent line through the center point of the front end and/or back end, with the line parallel to the longitudinal axis of the top sheet and tangent to the center point of the central portion of the elasticated area. 
     The elasticated areas herein may be formed by attaching an elasticated material in stretched state or in a partial stretched state to the top sheet or to one or more carrier materials that are then subsequently attached to the top sheet. The elastic materials may be in the form of a multitude of strands or a single band with an average thickness (e.g., gauge) of at least 20 microns, at least 40 microns, or at least 60 microns. In some embodiments, the elastic material has an average thickness up to about 300 microns, up to 200 microns, or up to 150 microns. Suitable materials may have an average thickness of about 70 to 100 microns. Suitable elastic materials used herein may include VFE-CD, available from Tredegar, and L-86, L-89, or L-90, available from Fulflex (Limerick, Ireland). 
     The absorbent article  302  may be sag-tolerable and may include a top sheet  311  that is sag-tolerable. This means that the top sheet does not sag when the back sheet and absorbent core sag due to increased weight of the body exudates received by the article. In addition, the top sheet keeps its z-direction alignment with the anal region and genitals of the wearer, and may also keep its x and y direction alignment. The absorbent article (e.g., diaper or training pants) may include a means to ensure that the top sheet stays in about the same contact or close proximity with the wearer&#39;s anal and/or genital region when the back sheet and core sag, compared to just after application of the article to the wearer, when the back sheet and core do not yet sag. In some embodiments, the top sheet is sag-tolerable such that when the geometrical center point of the back sheet is pulled down 4 cm, (i) the top sheet does not move down more than 0.5 cm, more than 0.25 cm, or does not move down at all, and/or (ii) the longitudinal side edges of the opening do not move in the x and y direction more than 0.5 cm, more than 0.25 cm, or do not move at all. 
     In some embodiments, the top sheet  311  may be sag-tolerable and thereto non-elastically extendable and may have thereto one or more transverse folds and/or longitudinal folds  357 , as shown in  FIGS. 13-14 , in a non-elasticated area  334 . In some configurations, the average width of the top sheet  311 , including the width of the opening  314 , may be larger than the average distance between the longitudinal attachment areas of the top sheet  311  to the back sheet  312 . In other configurations, the average width of the top sheet, including the width of the opening, may be larger than the average width of the back sheet. As such, the top sheet may, for example, have one or more transverse and/or longitudinal folds, which can unfold in use and allow sagging of the core and back sheet, while the top sheet remains in place. In some embodiments, the top sheet  311  with the longitudinal folds  357  is not attached to the absorbent core  214 , but directly to the back sheet  312  with longitudinal attachment lines  323 , to ensure that the diaper  302  and the top sheet  311  thereof are sag-tolerable. 
     In one embodiment, the absorbent article  10  may include one more top sheets that facilitate passage of bowel movement through the top sheets and into the at least one cavity  215 . Examples of such top sheets are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0092900, U.S. Pat. No. 5,342,338, European Patent Application Publication No. 1201212. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,342,338 to Roe, the absorbent article  10  may include a first top sheet with apertures large enough for low-viscosity fecal material to pass through it. 
     The amount of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  present in the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) may vary, but in certain embodiments, is present in the absorbent core in an amount greater than about 80% by weight of the absorbent core, or greater than about 85% by weight of the absorbent core, or greater than about 90% by weight of the absorbent core, or greater than about 95% by weight of the core. In a particular embodiment, the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) consists essentially of the first and second substrates  64  and  72 , the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 , and the thermoplastic adhesive composition  68  and  76 . In an embodiment, the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) may be substantially cellulose free. 
     In certain embodiments which are not substantially cellulose free, the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) can include some amount of cellulosic fiber material, such as airfelt. A relatively low amount of cellulosic material is used, in certain embodiments, which may be less than about 40 weight percent, or about 20 weight percent of cellulosic material, as compared to the weight of absorbent core. 
     According to certain embodiments, the basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  in at least one freely selected first square measuring 1 cm×1 cm in a zone of greater absorbent particulate polymer material basis weight may be at least 10%, or 20%, or 30%, 40% or 50% higher than the basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  in at least one freely selected second square measuring 1 cm×1 cm in a zone of lesser absorbent particulate polymer material basis weight. In a certain embodiment, the first and the second square are centered about the longitudinal axis. 
     According to an embodiment, a suitable absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 , even in the swollen state, i.e., when liquid has been absorbed, does not substantially obstruct the liquid flow throughout the material, especially when the material has a permeability, as expressed by the saline flow conductivity of the absorbent polymer material, of greater than about 10, 40, 80, 100, 110, 120, 150, or 200×10 −7  cm 3 ·sec/g and a centrifuge retention capacity (CRC) of greater than about 20 g/g, greater than about 25 g/g, or less than about 40 g/g, less than about 35 g/g. Saline flow conductivity is a parameter well recognized in the art and is to be measured in accordance with the test disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0219521. Centrifuge retention capacity is another parameter well recognized in the art and is to be measured in accordance with the test disclosed hereinbelow. According to a certain embodiment, the absorbent polymer material has an Absorption Against Pressure (AAP) of at least about 20 g/g, greater than about 23 g/g, or greater than about 25 g/g as measured according to the test described below. Absorbent polymer materials for use in certain embodiments have a basis weight of at least about 200 g/m 2 , at least about 400 g/m 2 , or at least about 600 g/m 2 . To maintain flexibility the basis weight is desirably less than about 2000 g/m 2 . 
     In certain embodiments wherein the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) is substantially cellulose free, the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) has a density greater than about 0.4 g/m 3 , greater than about 0.5 g/m 3 , or greater than about 0.6 g/m 3 . 
     According to an embodiment, the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  may be present in the diaper  10  so as to impart an average basis weight of more than about 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 or 900 g/m 2 . The diaper  10  (or  302 ), according to an exemplary embodiment, may have a relatively narrow crotch width for increased wearing comfort. The diaper  10  (or  302 ) may have a crotch width of less than about 100 mm, 90 mm, 80 mm, 70 mm, 60 mm or even less than about 50 mm. Hence, the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ), according to an embodiment, may have a crotch width as measured along a transversal line which is positioned at equal distance to the front edge and the rear edge of the core which is less than about 100 mm, 90 mm, 80 mm, 70 mm, 60 mm or even less than about 50 mm, as measured along a transversal line which is positioned at equal distance to the front edge and the rear edge of the core. It has been found that, for most absorbent articles such as diapers, the liquid discharge occurs predominately in the front half of the diaper. The front half of the absorbent core  14  may therefore comprise most of the absorbent capacity of the core. Thus, according to certain embodiments, the front half of said absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) may comprise more than about 60% of the absorbent capacity, or more than about 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or 90% of the absorbent capacity. 
     In certain embodiments, the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) may further comprise any absorbent material that is generally compressible, conformable, non-irritating to the wearer&#39;s skin, and capable of absorbing and retaining liquids such as urine and other certain body exudates. In such embodiments, the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) may comprise a wide variety of liquid-absorbent materials commonly used in disposable diapers and other absorbent articles such as comminuted wood pulp, which is generally referred to as airfelt, creped cellulose wadding, melt blown polymers, including co-form, chemically stiffened, modified or cross-linked cellulosic fibers, tissue, including tissue wraps and tissue laminates, absorbent foams, absorbent sponges, or any other known absorbent material or combinations of materials. The absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) may further comprise minor amounts (typically less than 10%) of non-liquid absorbent materials, such as adhesives, waxes, oils and the like. 
     Exemplary absorbent structures for use as the absorbent assemblies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,610,678 (Weisman et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,735 (Alemany et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 4,888,231 (Angstadt); U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,345 (DesMarais et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,207 (Dyer et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 5,397,316 (LaVon et al.); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,222 (DesMarais et al.). 
     In a certain embodiment best illustrated in  FIG. 2 , the elasticized leg cuffs  24  may comprise absorbent particulate polymer material  66  which may be laid down directly of the elasticized legs cuffs  24  in the same manner as the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  is laid down on first substrate  64  (described below) or may be formed on a separate substrate and added later. 
     The thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may serve to cover and at least partially immobilize the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 . In one embodiment of the present invention, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  can be disposed essentially uniformly within the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 . However, in a certain embodiment, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may be provided as a fibrous layer which is at least partially in contact with the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  and partially in contact with the substrate layers  64  and  72  of the first and second absorbent layers  60  and  62 .  FIGS. 3, 4, and 7  show such a structure, and in that structure, the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  is provided as a discontinuous layer, and a layer of fibrous thermoplastic material  68  and  76  is laid down onto the layer of absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 , such that the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  is in direct contact with the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 , but also in direct contact with the second surfaces  80  and  84  of the substrates  64  and  72 , where the substrates are not covered by the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 . This imparts an essentially three-dimensional structure to the fibrous layer of thermoplastic material  68  and  76 , which in itself is essentially a two-dimensional structure of relatively small thickness, as compared to the extension in length and width directions. In other words, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  undulates between the absorbent particulate polymer material  68  and  76  and the second surfaces of the substrates  64  and  72 . 
     Thereby, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may provide cavities to cover the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 , and thereby immobilizes this material. In a further aspect, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  bonds to the substrates  64  and  72  and thus affixes the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  to the substrates  64  and  72 . Thus, in accordance with certain embodiments, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  immobilizes the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  when wet, such that the absorbent core  14  achieves a wet immobilization of more than about 50%, or more than about 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% according to the Wet Immobilization Test. The Wet Immobilization Test is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0162536, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Some thermoplastic materials will also penetrate into both the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  and the substrates  64  and  72 , thus providing for further immobilization and affixation. According to certain embodiments, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may have an effective mesh size less than 300 microns. 
     Of course, while the thermoplastic materials disclosed herein provide a much improved wet immobilization (i.e., immobilization of absorbent material when the article is wet or at least partially loaded), these thermoplastic materials may also provide a very good immobilization of absorbent material when the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) is dry. 
     According to certain embodiments, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  can comprise any thermoplastic material, including, but not limited to adhesive thermoplastic materials, also referred to as hot melt adhesives. Some initially thermoplastic materials may later lose their thermoplasticity due to a curing step, e.g., initiated via heat, UV radiation, electron beam exposure or moisture or other means of curing, leading to the irreversible formation of a crosslinked network of covalent bonds. Those materials having lost their initial thermoplastic behavior are herein also understood as thermoplastic materials. 
     Without wishing to be bound by theory, it has been found that those thermoplastic materials which are most useful for immobilizing the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  combine good cohesion and good adhesion behavior. Good adhesion may promote good contact between the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  and the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  and the substrates  64  and  72 . Good cohesion reduces the likelihood that the adhesive breaks, in particular in response to external forces, and namely in response to strain. When the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) absorbs liquid, the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  swells and subjects the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  to external forces. In certain embodiments, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may allow for such swelling, without breaking and without imparting too many compressive forces, which would restrain the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  from swelling. 
     In accordance with certain embodiments, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may comprise, in its entirety, a single thermoplastic polymer or a blend of thermoplastic polymers, having a softening point, as determined by the ASTM Method D-36-95 “Ring and Ball”, in the range between 50° C. and 300° C., or alternatively the thermoplastic material may be a hot melt adhesive comprising at least one thermoplastic polymer in combination with other thermoplastic diluents such as tackifying resins, plasticizers and additives such as antioxidants. In certain embodiments, the thermoplastic polymer has typically a molecular weight (Mw) of more than 10,000 and a glass transition temperature (Tg) usually below room temperature or 0° C.&lt;T g &lt;20° C. In certain embodiments, typical concentrations of the polymer in a hot melt are in the range of about 20 to about 40% by weight. In certain embodiments, thermoplastic polymers may be water insensitive. Exemplary polymers are (styrenic) block copolymers including A-B-A triblock structures, A-B diblock structures and (A-B)n radial block copolymer structures wherein the A blocks are non-elastomeric polymer blocks, typically comprising polystyrene, and the B blocks are unsaturated conjugated diene or (partly) hydrogenated versions of such. The B block is typically isoprene, butadiene, ethylene/butylene (hydrogenated butadiene), ethylene/propylene (hydrogenated isoprene), and mixtures thereof. 
     Other suitable thermoplastic polymers that may be employed are metallocene polyolefins, which are ethylene polymers prepared using single-site or metallocene catalysts. Therein, at least one comonomer can be polymerized with ethylene to make a copolymer, terpolymer or higher order polymer. Also applicable are amorphous polyolefins or amorphous polyalphaolefins (APAO) which are homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers of C2 to C8 alphaolefins. 
     In exemplary embodiments, the resin has typically a Mw below 5,000 and a Tg usually above room temperature, typical concentrations of the resin in a hot melt are in the range of about 30 to about 60%, and the plasticizer has a low Mw of typically less than 1,000 and a Tg below room temperature, with a typical concentration of 0-15%. 
     In certain embodiments, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  is present in the form of fibers. In some embodiments, the fibers will have an average thickness of about 1 to about 50 micrometers or about 1 to about 35 micrometers and an average length of about 5 mm to about 50 mm or about 5 mm to about 30 mm. To improve the adhesion of the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  to the substrates  64  and  72  or to any other layer, in particular any other non-woven layer, such layers may be pre-treated with an auxiliary adhesive. 
     In certain embodiments, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  will meet at least one, or several, or all of the following parameters: 
     An exemplary thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may have a storage modulus G′ measured at 20° C. of at least 30,000 Pa and less than 300,000 Pa, or less than 200,000 Pa, or between 140,000 Pa and 200,000 Pa, or less than 100,000 Pa. The storage modulus G′ at 20° C. may be a measure for the permanent “tackiness” or permanent adhesion of the thermoplastic material used. In a further aspect, the storage modulus G′ measured at 35° C. may be greater than 100,000 Pa. In a further aspect, the storage modulus G′ measured at 60° C. may be less than 300,000 Pa and more than 18,000 Pa, or more than 24,000 Pa, or more than 30,000 Pa, or more than 90,000 Pa. The storage modulus measured at 60° C. may be a measure for the form stability of the thermoplastic material at elevated ambient temperatures. This value is particularly important if the absorbent product is used in a hot climate where the thermoplastic material would lose its integrity if the storage modulus G′ at 60° C. is not sufficiently high. 
     G′ is typically measured using a rheometer as schematically shown in  FIG. 11  for the purpose of general illustration only. The rheometer  127  is capable of applying a shear stress to the adhesive and measuring the resulting strain (shear deformation) response at constant temperature. The adhesive is placed between a Peltier-element acting as lower, fixed plate  128  and an upper plate  129  with a radius R of e.g., 10 mm, which is connected to the drive shaft of a motor to generate the shear stress. The gap between both plates has a height H of e.g., 1500 micron. The Peltier-element enables to control the temperature of the material (+0.5° C.). 
     In a further embodiment, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may have a deformation resistance strain in % between about 20 and about 90. 
     In a further aspect, the loss angle tan Delta of the adhesive at 60° C. may be below the value of 2, or below the value of 1, or below the value of 0.5. The loss angle tan Delta at 60° C. is correlated with the liquid character of an adhesive at elevated ambient temperatures. The lower tan Delta, the more an adhesive behaves like a solid rather than a liquid, i.e., the lower its tendency to flow or to migrate and the lower the tendency of an adhesive superstructure as described herein to deteriorate or even to collapse over time. This value is hence particularly important if the absorbent article is used in a hot climate. 
     In a further embodiment, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may have a glass transition temperature T g  of less than 25° C., or less than 22° C., or less than 18° C., or less than 15° C. A low glass transition temperature T g  is beneficial for good adhesion. In a further embodiment, a low glass transition temperature T g  ensures that the adhesive thermoplastic material does not become too brittle. 
     In a further embodiment, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may have an elasticity factor from about 10 to about 20. 
     In yet a further embodiment, the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  may have a sufficiently high cross-over temperature. A sufficiently high cross-over temperature T x  has been found beneficial for high temperature stability of the thermoplastic layer and hence it ensures good performance of the absorbent product and in particular good wet immobilization even under conditions of hot climates and high temperatures. Therefore, T x  may be above 80° C., or above 85° C., above 90° C., or above 95° C. 
     As described hereinabove, the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) may also comprise an auxiliary adhesive layer  69 . The auxiliary adhesive may be deposited on the first and second substrates  64  and  72  of the respective first and second absorbent layers  60  and  62  before application of the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  for enhancing adhesion of the absorbent particulate polymer materials  66  and  74  and the thermoplastic material  68  and  76  to the respective substrates  64  and  72 . The auxiliary glue  69  may also aid in immobilizing the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74  and may comprise the same thermoplastic material as described hereinabove or may also comprise other adhesives including but not limited to sprayable hot melt adhesives, such as H.B. Fuller Co. (St. Paul, Minn.) Product No. HL-1620-B. The auxiliary glue may be applied to the substrates  64  and  72  by any suitable means, but according to certain embodiments, may be applied in about 0.5 to about 1 mm wide slots spaced about 0.5 to about 2 mm apart. 
     The cover layer  70  shown in  FIG. 4  may comprise the same material as the substrates  64  and  72 , or may comprise a different material. In certain embodiments, suitable materials for the cover layer  70  are the non-woven materials, typically the materials described above as useful for the substrates  64  and  72 . 
     In a certain embodiment not illustrated, the absorbent core  14  (or  214 ) may be wrapped by a core wrap material. In one embodiment, the core wrap material comprises a top layer and a bottom layer. The core wrap material, the top layer or the bottom layer may be provided from a non-woven material. Such a core wrap may be provided from two or more separate sheets of materials or they may be alternatively provided from a unitary sheet of material. A unitary sheet of material may be wrapped around the storage layer  60 , e.g., in a C-fold. 
     In a certain embodiment, the absorbent core  214  is substantially cellulose free. In this embodiment, the cavity  215  advantageously provides a void volume for the fecal matter even when the absorbent core is already liquid, e.g., urine) loaded. Moreover, it provides bowel movement distribution toward the back of the diaper, away from the wearer&#39;s genitals, providing easier clean up. In an embodiment with an elasticized top sheet  311 , the cavity  215  advantageously works as a space between the absorbent core  214  and the elasticized top sheet  311 , so that the bowel movement is directed underneath the top sheet. In addition, in an embodiment where there is little or no absorbent particulate polymer material at the bottom of the cavity, when a bowel movement gets into the cavity, it becomes visible from the outside through the back sheet. This advantageously may serve as a positive signaling function for the caretaker of the wearer to check/change the diaper or training pant. 
     In one embodiment, the visibility of the at least one cavity  215  is enhanced by the inclusion of a color, print, pattern, or a combination thereof, in one or more layers of the absorbent article. For example, in one case, the cavity may be made more visible by including a colored (i.e., non-white) layer below the cavity, such that the color can be seen in the cavity due to the lower (or zero) basis weight in that region of the absorbent core. In another embodiment, a colored layer may be added over top of the cavity, e.g., the core cover, top sheet, or as a new, additional layer. 
     Method and Apparatus for Making Absorbent Articles 
     A printing system  130  for making an absorbent core  14  in accordance with an embodiment of this invention is illustrated in  FIG. 16  and may generally comprise a first printing unit  132  for forming the first absorbent layer  60  of the absorbent core  14  and a second printing unit  134  for forming the second absorbent layer  62  of the absorbent core  14 . It is understood throughout the following description that this system would be equally applicable to the making of absorbent core  214 . 
     The first printing unit  132  may comprise a first auxiliary adhesive applicator  136  for applying an auxiliary adhesive  69  to the substrate  64 , which may be a nonwoven web, a first rotatable support roll  140  for receiving the substrate  64 , a hopper  142  for holding absorbent particulate polymer material  66 , a printing roll  144  for transferring the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  to the substrate  64 , and a thermoplastic material applicator  146  for applying the thermoplastic material  68  to the substrate  64  and the absorbent particulate polymer  66  material thereon. 
     The second printing unit  134  may comprise a second auxiliary adhesive applicator  148  for applying an auxiliary adhesive  73  to the second substrate  72 , a second rotatable support roll  152  for receiving the second substrate  72 , a second hopper  154  for holding the absorbent particulate polymer material  74 , a second printing roll  156  for transferring the absorbent particulate polymer material  74  from the hopper  154  to the second substrate  72 , and a second thermoplastic material applicator  158  for applying the thermoplastic material  76  to the second substrate  72  and the absorbent particulate polymer material  74  thereon. 
     The printing system  130  also includes a guide roller  160  for guiding the formed absorbent core from a nip  162  between the first and second rotatable support rolls  140  and  152 . 
     The first and second auxiliary applicators  136  and  148  and the first and second thermoplastic material applicators  146  and  158  may be a nozzle system which can provide a relatively thin but wide curtain of thermoplastic material. 
     Turning to  FIG. 17 , portions of the first hopper  142 , first support roll  140 , and first printing roll  144  are illustrated. As also shown in  FIG. 20 , the first rotatable support roll  140 , which has the same structure as the second rotatable support roll  152 , comprises a rotatable drum  164  and a peripheral vented support grid  166  for receiving the first substrate  64 . 
     As also illustrated in  FIG. 18 , the first printing roll  144 , which has the same structure as the second printing roll  156 , comprises a rotatable drum  168  and a plurality of absorbent particulate polymer material reservoirs  170  and  171  in a peripheral surface  172  of the drum  168 . The reservoirs  170  and  171 , best illustrated in  FIG. 19 , may have a variety of shapes, including cylindrical, conical, or any other shape. The reservoirs  170  and  171  may lead to an air passage  174  in the drum  168  and comprise a vented cover  176  for holding adhesive particulate polymer material  66  in the reservoir and preventing the adhesive particulate polymer material  66  from falling or being pulled into the air passage  174 . 
     The first printing roll  144  is designed to produce a certain embodiment like the absorbent core  14  illustrated in  FIG. 5  wherein side absorbent zones  120  and  122  have a higher basis weight of absorbing particulate polymer material  66  and  74  than the central absorbent zone  121 . In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 19 , this effect may be achieved by having a corresponding set of reservoirs  170  which are relatively deep and a second set  171  of reservoirs which are relatively shallow, such that the deeper reservoirs  170  carry more absorbent particulate polymer material and deliver more absorbent particulate polymer material  66  to the side absorbent zones  120  and  122  and the more shallow reservoirs  171  hold less adhesive particulate polymer material and deliver less absorbent particulate polymer material  66  to the central zone  121  of the absorbent core  14 . The sets of deeper and shallower reservoirs  170  and  171 , of course, can be arranged in any variety of patterns to define the cavity  215  of absorbent core  214 , as well as in configurations to create an absorbent core with any corresponding variety of varying absorbent particulate polymer material basis weights across the absorbent core  214 .  FIG. 19 , in particular, illustrates the difference in volumetric sizes of first and second sets of reservoirs  170  and  171 . 
     Other methods of forming the cavity and delivering a varying profile of absorbent particulate polymer basis weights to the absorbent core  14  or  214  include, but are not limited to, applying a higher vacuum in sections of the first and second rotatable support rolls  140  and  152  where more absorbent particulate polymer material is desired or, when the absorbent particulate polymer material is delivered to the absorbent core substrate  64  pneumatically, such as when combining cellulosic fibers with absorbent particulate polymer material, directing the air stream carrying the absorbent particulate polymer material and cellulosic fibers to areas of the absorbent core substrate where a higher basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material is desired. 
     In operation, the printing system  130  receives the first and second substrate  64  and  72  into the first and second printing units  132  and  134 , respectively, the first substrate  64  is drawn by the rotating first support roll  140  past the first auxiliary adhesive applicator  136  which applies the first auxiliary adhesive to the first substrate  64  in a pattern such as described hereinabove. A vacuum (not shown) within the first support roll  140  draws the first substrate  64  against the vertical support grid  166  and holds the first substrate  64  against the first support roll  140 . This presents an uneven surface on the first substrate  64 . Due to gravity, or by using the vacuum means, the substrate  64  will follow the contours of the uneven surface and thereby the substrate  64  will assume a mountain and valley shape. The absorbent particulate polymer material  66  may accumulate in the valleys presented by the substrate  64 . The first support roll  140  then carries the first substrate  64  past the rotating first printing roll  144  which transfers the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  from the first hopper  142  to the first substrate  64  in the grid pattern  92  which is best illustrated in  FIGS. 5 and 6 . A vacuum (not shown) in the first printing roll  144  may hold the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  in the reservoirs  170  until time to deliver the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  to the first substrate  64 . The vacuum may then be released or air flow through the air passages  174  may be reversed to eject the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  from the reservoirs and onto the first substrate  64 . The absorbent particulate polymer material  66  may accumulate in the valleys presented by the substrate  64 . The support roll  140  then carries the printed first substrate  64  past the thermoplastic material applicator  136  which applies the thermoplastic material  68  to cover the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  on the first substrate  64 . 
     Hence, the uneven surface of the vented support grid  166  of the support rolls  140  and  152  determines the distribution of absorbent particulate polymeric material  66  and  74  throughout the absorbent core  14  and likewise determines the pattern of junction areas  96 . 
     Meanwhile, the second rotatable support roll draws the second substrate  72  past the second auxiliary adhesive applicator  148  which applies an auxiliary adhesive to the second substrate  72  in a pattern such as is described hereinabove. The second rotatable support roll  152  then carries the second substrate  72  past the second printing roll  156  which transfers the absorbent particulate polymer material  74  from the second hopper  154  to the second substrate  72  and deposits the absorbent particulate polymer material  74  in the grid pattern  92  on the second substrate  72  in the same manner as described with regard to the first printing unit  132  above. The second thermoplastic material applicator  158  then applies the thermoplastic material  76  to cover the absorbent particulate polymer material  74  on the second substrate  72 . The printed first and second substrates  64  and  72  then pass through the nip  162  between the first and second support rolls  140  and  152  for compressing the first absorbent layer  60  and second absorbent layer  62  together to form the absorbent core  14 . 
     In an optional further process step a cover layer  70  may be placed upon the substrates  64  and  72 , the absorbent particulate polymer material  66  and  74 , and the thermoplastic material  68  and  76 . In another embodiment, the cover layer  70  and the respective substrate  64  and  72  may be provided from a unitary sheet of material. The placing of the cover layer  70  onto the respective substrate  64  and  72  may then involve the folding of the unitary piece of material. 
       FIGS. 21-23  illustrate certain embodiments of printing rolls  144 ′ and  144 ″ for making corresponding embodiments of absorbent cores  14 ′ and  14 ″ illustrated in  FIGS. 9 and 10 , respectively. As shown in  FIGS. 21 and 22 , the printing roll  144 ′ for making the absorbent core  14 ′ illustrated in  FIG. 9  comprises sets of deeper and shallower reservoirs  170 ′ and  171 ′ for forming the end absorbent zones  123  and  124 , which have a higher absorbent particulate polymer material basis weight, and the central absorbent zone  125 , which has a lower absorbent particulate polymer material basis weight, respectively. Likewise, the printing roll  144 ″ has sets of deeper and shallower reservoirs  170 ″ and  171 ″, respectively, for forming the side absorbent zones  120 ′ and  122 ′ and end absorbent zones  123 ′ and  124 ′, having a higher basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material, and the central zone  121 ′ and  125 ′ having a lower basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material. This technique of profiling the absorbent particulate polymer material in both the MD and CD may be readily adapted to form a cavity, defined at least in part by the lower basis weight of absorbent particulate polymer material in an elongated central region. 
     Absorbent articles such as the diapers  10  made in accordance with embodiments of this invention may be folded and packaged for distribution and sale. Absorbent articles are typically bi-folded, but may also be tri-folded. After folding, the folded absorbent articles may be stacked to form a stack comprising a plurality of absorbent articles. The stack may then be compressed and encased in a packaging material such as a bag, a pouch, a box, or the like.
